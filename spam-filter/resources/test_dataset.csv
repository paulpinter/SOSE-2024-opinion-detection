358552,2014-06-14,920,160981,0,3,"I read all the reviews and was totally excited to go. We went, nice atmosphere,  smmaalllll space but eh. We were seated and the menu is on this cute clipboard thingy. We ordered but as first timers it would've been nice to have been told the menu basics by the waitstaff (for instance I missed the part about ordering the lean or fatty brisket). Our meal came, brisket was good, potato salad was eh but not bad, pickled onions were great. We had ordered soda and beer but the waiter forgot. He apologetically took it off the receipt and offered two free rounds a beer. We'll be back but we'll take it to go. And ask for extra onions."
358553,2014-06-14,920,32995,0,3,"This place is pretty standard tasting BBQ, I'm not sure what's with the glowing reviews. Service was slow and a little spacey. This has nothing to do with the restaurant but last time we were there, there was a big table full of Google Glass people. They looked so ridiculous and I wonder why they need them on while they're eating? Brisket needs to be live-tweeted or something?"
358554,2014-06-13,920,160982,0,5,Never in my life have I had BBQ this heavenly. I'm from Texas and I have had my share of BBQ. When I miss home I go to BrisketTown. I highly recommend that any Texan living in New York try this place out.
358555,2014-06-06,920,149108,0,4,"Seriously the best brisket, ribs, and pulled pork around. Loved the potato salad and the beans. And, really into the raw onions with the pickles. I love raw onions. I would just eat those here and be happy. But, the meat was phenomenal!"
358556,2014-06-02,920,147518,0,4,"Coming from North Jersey, the food needs to be pretty damn good to warrant such a commute.  The brisket here warrants it.  Texas inspired, smoked brisket, ribs, pulled pork, sausages, etc.  It's all delicious, thinking about it now, I'll venture out and call it 'mouth watering'.  Small venue, tiny bar on the left, tables throughout and a meat counter in the back.  Originally a walk up counter, sit anywhere facility, it's now evolved into a full service restaurant.  The hostess in charge was very friendly and inviting.  Our 'waiter' was a bit on the slow side for what was a not so busy time.  Drinks took much longer than they should have, we suspect he was new.  Beer selection is small, but it's a good selection.  Food is great, I'd recommend it to anyone.  I even considered catering for my wedding at one point, that kind of good.  The owner has invested a lot of time into the food and it's an experience everyone should try at least once, but likely you'll keep coming back for more."
358557,2014-05-29,920,73191,0,4,"If you like dry style BBQ you'll like this place. Typically I like my BBQ with a good BBQ sauce so when I found out they have no sauce to serve it with only hot sauce I was a bit skeptical. To my surprise the brisket was excellent. We got mainly fatty and it was juicy and great flavor. Ribs were good too but I prefer mine saucy. For sides we got the Mac and cheese which was my favorite, the beans which were ok, the collard greens which were so so and coleslaw which was totally bland. I love coleslaw with my BBQ bc it cuts through the richness off the meat however this one had no bite and no flavor. That was a little disappointing. Mighty Quinn's is still my favorite BBQ place but the brisket at brisket town comes in at a close second."
358558,2014-05-24,920,160983,0,2,"Summary: Surprisingly disappointing experience. Food was mediocre. Slow, frustrating service (see below for explanation). Out of several food items on a small menu (including pork ribs, a staple item) by 9pm on a Saturday evening. Food: We ordered the wedge salad, collard greens, 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 lb pulled pork. They were out of pork ribs, peach pie and cabernet on a Saturday night at 9pm. (The menu is quite small.) Pulled pork and collard greens were fine, wedge salad pretty good. Brisket was surprisingly dry and not flavorful. No sauces other than hot sauce. Pickles were good, though. Service: Slow to take order. Had multiple servers covering our table, which (predictably) resulted in part of our order, the beef brisket, getting lost. They were unapologetic about the mistake, and then we were charged for 2 1/2 lb orders of brisket. When we pointed out the further mistake they were again unapologetic, and they argued a fair bit before relenting. Rarely write Yelp reviews, but this was a frustrating experience. Not worth the money or time. Fette Sau is nearby; try that, or Mighty Quinn in the EV, before this."
358559,2014-05-20,920,89780,0,3,"The meat was cooked properly. The problem is it's not cooked onsite. Not surprising when you consider the space constrictions of New York. Sadly, the off site facility was either too far away or was in an igloo. Our 'first' order of brisket, while moist, was well below room temperature. The second round was from a ""new brisket,"" our waiter cryptically proclaimed. A statement that begged the question how recently this 'new' plate met it's demise. Overall a shallow and subtle bark that is wonderfully seasoned. The smoke rings penetrated as far as would a pre-teen on his first co-ed overnight sleepover. Leaving both the recipient and this diner wanting. I must also mention the juxtaposition of the ambiance. On one side you have a sign, albeit neon, announcing your arrival to ""brisket town"" and the other with white linen tablecloths and faux erudite table service. I was confused. Was I in a sanctuary of meat product or a delicate French restaurant? Either would've been acceptable but not a mix betwixt the two. You will get a decent if not overpriced marginal barbecue product here. I'm now distrusting of driving your meat in from off site. Unless that off site is FRANKLIN's in Austin. I imagine this would be a great place to break up with someone. The sting of the failed relationship would be slightly offset by the flavour of the meat while also intensified by its cold demeanour. Leaving both parties equally confused."
358560,2014-05-19,920,5785,0,5,"This review is for my cousin. We had a discussion on Facebook where everyone misses the ""old"" Brooklyn. Everyone was saying Brooklyn is getting too gentrified and losing its identity. Back in the day, Bed-Sty was.. All these educated fools, Shut up! It is nice to reminisce about the old, trashy hood. Now pass me the brisket you hipsters and lets all sing koombaya together! I am so glad there is a Texas styled BBQ joint in Brooklyn! I magically found a parking spot right in front. I walked in on Saturday afternoon to a quaint shop with a few open tables. The menu isn't too complicated. I zeroed in one what I wanted, a pound of Texas style brisket with a side of beans. Simple. The brisket was cooked perfectly. Juicy, tender and flavorful. And the beans? Had a nice flavor, not too strong yet assertive. I ordered a beer, the total with tip was under $50 bucks. Amazing BBQ, its at the top of my BBQ list. Find this place, oh and bring granny or some other neighbors that was afraid to come here in the 80s. Because now Brooklyn is truly, in the house. Suck on that Spike Lee!"
358561,2014-05-16,920,5266,0,4,"Really good tender brisket, with a crispy, peppery crust. The waitress said it's seasoned only with salt and pepper, then smoked for a good long time. I loved it. Only wish they had a hotter hot sauce, also draft beer."
358562,2014-05-10,920,28924,0,3,"Four stars for the brisket, minus a star for the crappy service, and because they claim to be open late but run out of elemental food by 8. No sauce. You're at the mercy of the pitman, and just hope that he goes easy on the salt. Benefits from a healthy dose of green Tabasco. Service ranges from indifferent to nasty. On one visit, the owner and the cook were fighting, and the cook refused to serve. Twenty -! - minutes later, I got my food. They comped me a drink. Didn't make up for the bizarre scene. Get there before 9,at the latest, or they'll be out of, well, pretty much everything. Brisket really is delicious, though."
358563,2014-05-08,920,80553,0,5,"This place has the best bbq I have ever had in my life. I tried the Ribs, pulled pork, brisket,  and the collard greens. Everything I tried was the best I have ever eaten. If you enjoy bbq (usually I don't) you must try this out. I went because I have heard about it from many people and a friend was craving it.  Best decision I have made in a long while :) I definately will be back!"
358564,2014-05-05,920,51709,0,2,"Nothing special! Overpriced and low quality BBQ with no on tap beer!!! When other good places like Fette Sau are in few mins walking distance with much better BBQ, beer, and whiskey selection, there is no point of going to this place."
358565,2014-05-05,920,160984,0,5,"I'm a native Texan. I've had what's purported to be the best barbecue in Texas. All over Texas. Central, South, North, West; suffice it to say that I have eaten some serious deliciousness in my time. I never thought I'd be uttering these words, but in all my time as a Texan, I have never had barbecue as flawless as the meal I had last night at BrisketTown. The meat was inappropriately good. Succulent, charred and peppered to perfection, and so full of flavor that putting barbecue sauce on it would be an insult to the care that went into preparing it. I don't really know what else to say...I was floored by how good this was. I'm still floored. To think that this wonderful little place, tucked into South Williamsburg, dimly lit and beautifully designed, could turn out better barbecue than a Texas smokehouse...it's beyond me. And I'm hooked. Take it from a Texan. If you've ever wanted to experience real barbecue, done the right way, arguably BETTER than in its home state, go to BrisketTown."
358566,2014-05-04,920,153667,0,4,I love their brisket. Sometime stop in late night for. 1/4 pound which is not on menus. I prefer the tables. The bar area is a bit uncomfortable.  And could use a TV. But it seems most bars and restaurants in Williamsburg don't have TV's
358567,2014-05-04,920,160985,0,3,"Went here for a late lunch. Food was good, service was ok, decor was quaint. A bit on the pricy side for what you get (especially the pork ribs). Everything is a la carte. All in all it was good but not the first place to  come to mind when I crave BBQ."
358568,2014-05-03,920,30590,0,5,I felt like a cro-magnon in this place.
358569,2014-05-02,920,1814,0,4,"+++ - was empty around 1230pm on a Sunday, would be a good place to brunch if you're just looking for something to eat - the ribs exude fall off the bone greatness; they have great re-heat value too (although one has to be careful not to overbook them) ++ - portions; you get a lot of food - brisket is well spiced, it has a nice kick to it. This has great re-heat value too (you really have to careful not to over cook and over dry) TIPS: - 1/2 pound is good enough for your average make appetite, we ordered two, 1/2 pound orders (for a male and female) and there was more meat to consume in one meal (we were one rib over... U get 3 per order)"
358570,2014-04-20,920,6178,0,4,"I was skeptical but the brisket definitely lives up to the hype. Small place with a limited menu but it's really all about the meat here. Took away a star because there was no mac n cheese left which I think would have been a nice addition to our meal of brisket, pulled pork and potato salad. Added bonus that a 1/2 lb of meat was free (birthday email). The pickles and bread were an awesome compliment to the meat. We did not save room for dessert so I'll need to return to try the strawberry pie (and, hopefully, the mac n cheese). Friendly service as well."
358571,2014-04-13,920,21546,0,5,"Mine-O-mine. The BBQ was so good I didn't want it to end. We ordered half pound brisket, half pound ribs and coleslaw. The meat came with bread, pickles and onions. The brisket was juicy, tender and flavorful. It's a nice balance of lean and fatty cuts. The ribs were equally tasty. They were tender and fell off the bone only when I bit into them (they are not mushy). They are pre cut so they are very easy to eat and share. I love the coleslaw too. It's just a little vinegar and seasoning with unusual twist of basil or shisho leaves. It's not heavy like mayo based coleslaw and it's refreshing. The acidity and the hint of herb flavor paired nicely with the succulent BBQ. I love everything so much I went back 2 days later to get more as souvenir to bring back to Chicago with me. And they still taste amazing after all that travel."
358572,2014-04-04,920,49685,0,5,"came here on a friday night with a friend around 9pm and was seated right away. the smell of the slow cooked meat wafting through the air just makes my mouth water! my friend and i ordered the ribs, brisket, sausage, pork shoulder, kale and potato salad. they had just run out of the baked beans - no bueno! oh yes and two six point sweet actions in a can. Ribs were juicy, great texture, gave a little pull off the bone, pretty good tasting as well. My brisket was of a smaller cut so that made it a little drier that i had liked it. still pretty tender but needed a little more taste to it. Sausage was pretty well done with good flavor and texture. the pork shoulder IMO is the winner. Bursting with taste that'll send your taste buds to the moon, juicy and great texture! ORDER THE PORK SHOULDER, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. kale was stewed, soft, and vinegary. potato salad was on par. oh the pickles are awesome too! Six point sweet action was the tall boy can you find in a bodega with a foam bottle holder. only thing about that was it was not ice cold and that was a little disappointing. great ambience for a medium sized place with music thats not too loud to drown your convos. would definitely recommend this place to anyone needing a Cue fix and most certainly can contend with all the other nearby competition."
358573,2014-04-03,920,45706,0,3,"Really wanted to like this place. Stumbled on it and saw all the positive reviews. As a big fan off BBQ I was very excited. I gotta say the brisket was just okay (blasphemy?). Yes it was tender but I expected more flavor and more wow. I also ordered a side of cole slaw, which again was highly mediocre. Would potentially go back to try the other meat dishes, but overall slightly disappointing dining experience."
358574,2014-03-27,920,3873,0,5,"Every once in a while I experience an epiphany of grand proportions. Somehow I am transported into Cue Heaven and have the good fortune to taste amazing and delicious cue. This magic land where raw pork and beef, meet, fire and smoke; and then in a slow process of fusion with spices and a touch of BBQ skill is called BrisketTown. My wife and I ordered 1 lb each of ribs and brisket with a side of potato salad and collared greens. The meal arrived family style with lots of pickles and white bread. Ribs One pound of ribs consisted of six good size ribs. Appearance of a bark, ring and the pinkness of a slow cook meat very visible. Taste: OUTSTANDING. Ribs where moist with a slight pull. The bark had that pepper taste that was infused with the slow cook process. The spiciness of the rub just accented the meat without overpowering. This was definitely a high caliber rib. Lots of flavor. Ribs definitely where competition caliber. Nice size, color, magic BBQ ring, cut. Visually very good looking, but tasted better. Brisket I don't remember how many slices we received for our one pound order. When the plate arrived, I just pick up a slice and devourer. One slice after another. Finger licking good. Brisket was moist, tender, same peppery bark, BBQ ring and lots of flavor. While the brisket was not competition caliber, it was at a high level of taste and appearance. A must order. Sides Potato salad and collard greens where good, but I don't go to a cue joints for sides. Give me meat so I can ravenously destroy ribs and brisket. I do have to say that having a cool mayo side did enhance the flavor profile of the meats. Pickles; oh the pickles. Homemade and delicious. The acidity of the pickles with smoke meats certainly added to meat flavors. Overall, BrisketTown is a high tier BBQ joint. Ribs and brisket were as good as it gets; maybe better. BrisketTown is a must drive or subway ride to Brooklyn. Service was good. Beer selection limited. CC accepted. Pitmaster stop by the table. Very nice gesture. Gave my wife some pickles for the ride home. I highly recommend BrisketTown to the novice cue lover or the experience BBQ lover who attends competitions. My journey to Cue Heaven is now complete; till next time."
358575,2014-03-25,920,63377,0,1,"My husband and I ordered ribs and pulled pork  tonight and it was the worst ever. First, 30 minutes after we submit our order we get a call saying they were out of ribs so they were going to give us chili and more pulled pork. An hour later still no food, we then call and they tell us they are out of ribs, they hadn't yet left to deliver the meal. 10 minutes later the food arrives, warm but bland. I don't know how you can mess up pulled pork but they did.  For pulled pork go to mighty Quinn's instead. I learned my lesson."
358576,2014-03-24,920,35710,0,4,"I made two trips to Williamsburg this weekend and this was stop one.  I am not much of a brisket connoisseur, but everything about this place led to a great evening.  The brisket tasted fantastic, the beers were ice cold (and went down with ease w/ the brisket) and we even saved room for slice pie between 3 friends.  I'd perhaps pass on the pie if I went again, but everything else was great. Obviously the brisket is the star, but don't pass up the side dishes, like potato salad!."
358577,2014-03-23,920,160986,0,3,There was so much hype about this place I was expecting a lot. Brisket is flavorful. A bit salty and a bit dry. Like it's been sitting around too long. The sides were great! Ribs are the best bet. Pulled pork was pretty good too. I do like the decor. And the prices were more than reasonable. I guess the rave reviews created over optimistic expectations .
358578,2014-03-22,920,11195,0,5,"My friend had made a reservation here for a party with 10 people, my birthday party. Once we arrived, there was only 8 of us so they would not seat us until the other 2 arrived. Turns out it wouldn't have mattered anyway as the tables which were ours were still taken, even 45 minutes after 8. By the time we were about to sit, they tell us that there is only 1lb of meat left. Recall that we had a reservation, which is actually more of a meat reservation than a seat reservation, and they still ran out. We were pissed and stormed out, walking down the street to Fette Sau instead. What was the point of a reservation if we couldn't order any brisket, and we couldn't get a table at our reservation time? If you are a reader who pays attention, you should be questioning why I gave this place a 5-star review, despite all that happened. Well, my buddy who made the reservation sent an email to the owner telling him what happened, telling him that it was a big time fail and an epic embarrassment for him and my birthday party plans. The owner responded with an actual paper card with a handwritten apology, and a gift card on it. Epic customer service + apology + acknowledgment that you were in the wrong = excellent review and repeat customers. After that service, the meat would have to be pretty bad to get a negative rating from me, but luckily for us, BrisketTown meat is amaze-balls. I have been here once before and must say that the quality of brisket is like no other I have found in the city. The exterior rub is out of this world, and the meat so flavorful and tender. Definitely worth a trip if you call yourself part of the NYC meat scene."
358579,2014-03-17,920,160987,0,3,awesome brisket+BBQ - terrible terrible coleslaw and OK sides
358580,2014-03-17,920,160988,0,1,"Insanely bad delivery service. Don't bother ordering food from here, it won't arrive."
358581,2014-03-12,920,88003,0,5,"cant ask for anything more incredible food, amazing and talented creator, perfect ambience"
358582,2014-03-11,920,134026,0,5,"Two of us shared: 1/2 lb brisket, 1/2 lb ribs, 2 hot links, a side of baked beans, a side of collard greens. This was pretty much the perfect amount of food. Everything was amazing. I had had the brisket when the chef did a one-off ""Brisketlab"" night so I knew the food would be great. The space was cool too. That sort of rustic American look thats in now. Its not a huge space, though. Not a lot of tables. So, though we walked right in and got a table, that was because we came on a tuesday night. Any other time and I'm sure that wouldn't be the case. Apparently they take reservations so I bet its a good idea to do so."
358583,2014-03-09,920,104608,0,5,"The brisket in this place is AMAZING. I'm hard to convince with food (especially brisket), but this place caught me off guard. Their brisket is unique, only when you eat it and compare it to any other brisket you will understand what I mean. I have eaten here several times and I thought that it was about time to let others know. I would suggest more side dishes. Although the ones they have taste good. The employees are friendly and the place is clean. I hope this place does not change."
358584,2014-03-08,920,160989,0,5,"I have to say that I love this place! The brisket was some of the best I've ever had and the ribs, yes!!  Everything about this place I love. We had a bit of everything and our taste buds were happy. I'll be back for more potato salad and greens. Maybe we'll do dessert as well. Thanks BrisketTown for some awesome 'cue!"
358585,2014-03-08,920,1602,0,5,"I've been to Briskettown many times, but this last visit deserves a review. Back then it was BYOB and we were able to bring our own growlers. Now they have their liquor license, but I like the assortment of drinks, all reasonably priced. It was also self service so you have go find your own seat and hope it isn't too crowded (usually is). I'm glad they have a reservation system now so we don't have to pray for seats to pop up. They're still adjusting to this new system so the reservation messed up by an hour. Luckily the owner, Daniel Delaney, was very courteous about it and promised to settle the problem with the reservation company and gave us a round of drinks on the house. In the warmer weathers you can order the delicious Texas Caviar as a side (corn, beans, tomatoes, etc). They had beef rib on the menu before, but due to the fact that prices have been driven way up and hormones are injected into the meat, they took it off the menu. The brisket and hot links are absolutely delicious. Juicy and with just the right amount of rub. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good BBQ. We've been coming here since the early days and will continue to do so for a long time. P.S. Since they have table service now, they are phasing out IsThereMeatLeft.com"
358586,2014-03-08,920,12917,0,1,"Food was very mediocre. My friend raved about this place i wasn't impressed, the flavor of the brisket didn't seem anything special. It was lightly seasoned wasn't dry. The sides were pretty normal as well nothing amazing. All in all the food seemed very bland to me the place didn't even have barbecue sauce they gave us Mexican hot sauce to go with the brisket the flavors just didn't meld. Honestly i wouldn't go back. Ive been to real barbecue places with nice hearty bread and original barbecue sauce this place seemed like the McDonald's of the BBQ restaurants"
358587,2014-03-04,920,34748,0,5,"Being born and raised in Texas, I personally look for moistness, flavor, and a great fat/meat ratio on brisket, and this place has it. No nonsense kind of food, which is the way BBQ is meant. Just fresh meat flavored through patience and care. Definitely the lean choice is my favorite here along with the side of beans. Can't get more comfort food than that. Wasn't a big fan of their sweet tea, but could have caught them on a bad day(lacking flavor and mostly sugar water). One of the best, and the most satisfying meal I had in the city. I will now compare every BBQ place in nyc to this place."
358588,2014-03-02,920,55731,0,4,"Very casual joint.  Service can sometimes be a little slow, but that's just part of the vibe if anything.  I approach this place as an afternoon lunch spot, or an early evening happy hour snack spot.  In both cases, I get the brisket.  However, for happy hour I'm happiest with their beer + meat shot (big chunk of brisket in a shot glass).  A couple of those and I'm set!"
358589,2014-02-27,920,104568,0,3,"I was excited to try BrisketTown because it has my favorite food in their name. Sadly, I was a little disappointed. I ordered the fatty and the woman got the lean. The fatty wasn't too fatty. It was kind of stringy, with long strands of beef. The lean looked okay though. Flavor-wise, it was good. Meat-wise, meh... My NYC brisket rankings: 1) Mighty Quinn's 2) Fette Sau 3) (tie) BrisketTown & Hill Country 4) (tie) Blue Smoke & Dinosaur BBQ"
358590,2014-02-18,920,65404,0,4,"The brisket had that central Texas taste. A flavor profile you don't find much in NY. I ordered a half of pound of lean and half a pound of fatty. Usually, I prefer the fatty part of the brisket. However, I thought the lean was much better. The fatty had some big chunks of bad fat that wasn't rendered.  The seasoning was just salt and pepper. Just like in Texas. (they are a bit heavy handed with the pepper crust) The ribs were also very good. Fell right of the bone. The one thing I found odd was you sit at a table and place your order with a waiter. I enjoy the experience of walking up to a meat counter and placing an order."
358591,2014-02-16,920,42890,0,5,"Get the fatty brisket. You won't regret it!  I often find the best thing to do is actually to take the food to go and eat it at home.  Also makes great omelette (assuming there's any leftover!) Huge fan, and I always take locals and out of towners alike to experience the deliciousness."
358592,2014-02-11,920,152908,0,5,"Dam fine BBQ, Brisket was on point, owner was there and he was really nice,  and everything else was superb"
358593,2014-02-11,920,125404,0,2,"Pros: -Beautiful setting; rustic wooden tables, exposed brick, good music playing (oldies) -Tender well cooked meat, the kind that only needs the slightest indentation of your fork to cut -Good pie (the crust was amazing) Cons: -One person manning the bar and tables -Though the meat was tender it was bland; for those of us that do like barbecue sauce it would be nice if they at least offered it as an option on the tables -There was no sweet tea or cornbread (just slices of store bought potato bread) All in all, I would probably not go back."
358594,2014-02-07,920,3447,0,4,"After waiting slightly angrily for 45 minutes outside in the freezing cold for one of my friends to pick me up, and arriving fashionably over an hour late to dinner, a big group of 12-13 of us piled into BrisketTown. Some of us starving. Some of us just morbidly curious at how delicious can Delaney's Brisket possibly be? The tables are kind of like picnic tables. An assortment of two people tables pushed together. But there were also many two people tables going on that night still. You have a big neon cow sign flanking overhead and an incredibly fancy espresso machine behind the counter. I was both impressed with the courteousness of the staff for a. taking my coat and hanging it up for me and b. noting that I desperately needed a beer. My qualm here is that beverages are hipster chic. They only sell canned beer that will run you a dollar or two more than the average. Porkslap, SixPoint, Abita, etc. Then you have your $30 plus bottles of wine or $10 a glass. I went with the can of Abita and that was it for the night. Big spender. They do sell fancy coffee here and you can smell the divinity of it. But just saying, I love me some draft beer. You order family style here. At least, it is recommended. I don't particularly love family style. In part because I eat all sorts of animals and I was with an enormous party of Jews. So we ended up ordering a HUGE MASSIVE pile of brisket. (Next time I'm coming for the Pork, I swear.) The Brisket - It's mouth watering, delicate, and sumptuous. The best brisket that has ever descended upon my lips in my life. Make sure as well if you have the option to check out the lean form of the brisket because that truly was like eating meat if it was in the form of butter. Now I am going to turn cruel. The sides are not out of this world. I wish they were. But they are not. I tried a fork full of everything that my buddy Howie ordered. The coleslaw is the best because of the tangy flavor just going so well with all of that meat. The mustard potato salad lacks in any kind of flavor and needs to be revamped. The warm pinto beans in a chili tomato vegetable medley was nothing to write home about and again just lacks in flavor and tastes like something I could just find out of a can. Give me nutmeg. Or bacon. Lastly, I would love to see Delaney do his own take on macaroni. Come for the meat. Skip the sides. But oh, oh, that meat, it sure does warm my soul with glistening slabs of fatty goodness."
358595,2014-02-05,920,85564,0,2,I don't know what changed behind the scenes but this place has really gone downhill.  The food is now extremely oily and they take over two hours to deliver. Unacceptable.
358596,2014-02-04,920,21195,0,5,"I went with a pretty large group on a friday evening so i was scared that it would be packed, but luckily it wasn't too busy. we had like 10 people but we all found seats. Pros: the brisket and ribs... so tender.. melts in your mouth. one of the best ribs i've had in my life. I've had better brisket, but this is still one of the best.  the sides were really tasty too. I got the potato salad and collared greens. I recommend the potato salad for sure. make sure you get the sauces from the sauce table! (and the free slices of bread, if you don't want to eat just meat) cons: the price was a bit high for the small portions. maybe I just eat a lot (I do.) but half pound of ribs or brisket is not enough to satisfy. I wish i could have gotten half pound of each. I still give it 5 stars though because the taste was great! maybe next time I'll just get my friend to share some of his food with me haha."
358597,2014-02-01,920,160990,0,5,"The four of us rolled in like drunk bats out of hell after a show last night and we needed some meat immediately. At 9pm every restaurant was at least a one hr wait but Daniel and the staff were so killer and accommodating to our sloppy selves. The 20 - 30 minute wait flew by as he kept the wine + beers flowing and brought us a sausage + pickle snack plate. Entire staff was super nice, owner Daniel is such a good dude. In addition to undercharging us for the entire meal for no reason he also threw us three slices of pie that were phenomenal. Try the key lime + grasshopper for some thick graham crust goodness. Oh and the bbq meat delish too. duh."
358598,2014-01-26,920,18011,0,4,"I've been waiting to try BrisketTown for a while now after hearing about the affiliation with Franklin's and my love for brisket.  I was surprised at how small Briskettown was!  It is tiny inside.  Thankfully @6pm on a Sat night there was no wait for 2 people.   Got a small sampling of everything minus the links.  The brisket pieces were completely different- half of them were fatty, moist and delicious, but the other half were dry chunks charred on the outside.  I usually like char, but the meat was too dry and a bit disappointing.  But the longer cuts of brisket was cooked perfectly!  I was also impressed with their pulled pork.  It had such a wonderful piggy flavor to it and I appreciated that it wasn't masked by sauce and vinegar like other places.  Really juicy too.  And the ribs were cooked great with no sauce which I liked, good char, not smoky though.   App and sideswise, that cornbread is exactly what cornbread should taste like every time.  It was so good we asked for another helping for dessert with coffee instead of pie.  The collard greens were ""exquisite"" according to the BF.  They were really delicious and you can tell they cooked it with butter instead of pork fat like other places which let the greens flavor shine though.  The chili app was really full with chunks of brisket and pork and had a nice little kick to it.  The funny thing is though, because there was so much meat and not much else, I found myself longing for some beans and chunks of tomato or onion or something else for more depth.   Cans of beer available, not too many options.  I thought it was interesting they have such a large variety of wine instead- is it a cool thing to drink wine with BBQ?  I'll stick with the Sweet Action until someone convinces me otherwise.   The meat isn't cheap and I missed watching my meat get cut, but BrisketTown is a delicious sitdown option for BBQ (in NYC)."
358599,2014-01-20,920,160991,0,2,"The food was Subpar. If you decide that the style of your BBQ does not need a sauce to help with the experience than the main course should not have me searching for something otherwise. I was very disappointed to see that my condiment options were of a lesser value from the supermarket (cholula). The music was good, the ribs were not as dry as the brisket and the side were fun and well thought out. So to complete my review i will say this; a house shot of Jose Quervo (cholula's more popular family member) would of nailed the night. Oh! and thank you for the extra corn bread that was tasty with all that honey butter like goodness."
358600,2014-01-10,920,42860,0,4,"I've been dying to come here for a year and finally grabbed my son and nephew (home from college) and stopped by. Not crowded at all on a Thursday night, 7pm, although it did start to fill up a little more as the night went on (I was a little worried about seating since it's pretty small). The three of us ordered all four meats (pulled pork, hot link sausage, ribs and brisket) along with beans and collared greens. BTW - the order comes with pickles which were outstanding; I would have taken a bucket home if they were for sale. The hot link is like a kielbasa sausage to me, with just a little kick. Juicy and crisp on the outside. Good, but the least favorite of the four. Ribs were next up, moist, smoky and tender. No sauce and honestly could have used a little -- or a more assertive dry rub. Pulled pork was my personal favorite actually, nicely seasoned in a mild Carolina way. The brisket was as good as advertised, although we had two batches -- the first slightly dry and the second decadently juicy and fatty. No sauce needed (or offered). Beans were not my preferred style, but my two boys loved them; very thick, tomato/chili flavored. Collared greens were solid as well. The free cornbread was better than both. It was $120 for the three of us -- with one beer, two sodas and no dessert -- so not a bargain. Granted we ate a lot, but be prepared. If I came in blind, I would have enjoyed it more; I think my expectations were set too high. Will definitely come back again though."
358601,2014-01-09,920,82687,0,5,"Been here a few times. It is great! The Brisket is perfect and unlike ""some"" places, served hot! You can actually see the smoke rings and the various layers of flavor. I'm hooked! The ribs, which I finally tasted (i was hesitant to veer away from the brisket), were excellent as well. The Chorizo! also great.. just enough spice to make it interesting without being overwhelming. Had a small problem with my takeout last night, but they made it right! Immediately. Insisted. Love this place and you will too!"
358602,2014-01-07,920,44020,0,5,"I don't normally even like BBQ, but I really loved my meal here. I came here about a month ago for a friend's birthday. It was a very large group without a reservation in a very small, crowded restaurant. But somehow they managed to accommodate us. It's a very casual dining experience. Fresh BBQ served on paper plates with slices of wonder bread. Beers in cans. You couldn't ask for more authentic BBQ ambiance. You order your meat by the half-pound. The selection is limited. We had pulled pork and pork ribs - and later in the evening the waiter came around with a complimentary order of fresh brisket for us because they had been out when we ordered. It was some of the best brisket I've ever eaten. For sides, the collard greens were amazing. And the potato salad was great. We also tried a terrific pumpkin pie with a ginger-graham cracker crust. I think maybe my prejudice against BBQ is because I grew up in Detroit, where it's just awful - has the connotation of screaming children at trashy Fourth of July block parties in economically challenged neighborhoods. But I understand that in some parts of the country it's much more of an art. And I'm figuring out that in Brooklyn there are a couple of really good BBQ joints. BrisketTown is one of them."
358603,2014-01-05,920,160992,0,3,Got There at 9:30. Didn't get seated till after 10. They didn't tell us while we were waiting that they were out of Brisket. Why else would we come to Brisket town?! The pork ribs were good. Over all just ok. Service not the greatest.
358604,2014-01-04,920,72646,0,5,"Hot. Damn. This place is crazy good. The brisket and pork ribs are a must. I don't think I've ever seen ribs cleaned that quickly. And the brisket? Knife wasn't used once. It's all so tender and delicious. Nice place and great staff. They do sell out of types of food though so if you're dead set on brisket, either call ahead or improvise and eat everything else."
358605,2014-01-04,920,114152,0,5,"NO SAUCE NEEDED!!! Just enjoy the meat as it was intended!! The brisket, oh that brisket is amazing!! So soft and delicious with some nice fat. I never a brisket that came close this one. The pulled pork was some of the best that I have ever had. Most bbq joints will smother their pulled pork in sauce-not here. It was perfectly done. The hot link sausage was really good but not as good as the brisket or pulled pork. The sides were right on par with the main course...we had the collard greens (which were the best we've ever had!) baked beans and potato salad. If you're near Williamsburg find a place to park and have some of the best bbq of your life!"
358606,2014-01-02,920,62952,0,5,"UHHHHHHHHH You know you've struck gold when you order brisket by the pound and the ""plate"" is a sheet of paper covering the table. Meat is served with Texas toast and toppings so you can make your own brisket sandwich. The perfectly charred brisket is so tender you don't need a knife and so flavorful you don't need BBQ sauce. I'm sure the other stuff on the menu is good but there's no reason to fill up on anything except brisket."
358607,2013-12-31,920,40442,0,5,"BrisketTown is very similar to Fette Sau in terms of quality in food.  However, I like the atmosphere here way more.  At Fette Sau, you have to wait on the line and fight for seats.  At BrisketTown, you just have to wait to be seated.  A lot less stress imo.  The menu at BrisketTown is a set menu, unlike Fette Sau.  I think if they had a special of the week on the menu, it would be great."
358608,2013-12-27,920,154052,0,5,"The brisket and shredded pork were a-mazing. So tender and juicy. The salad wedge was also fun to eat. They have free pickles and bread for you to pack that meat into a sandwich :) Gets very crowded around the evening (we had to wait 45 minutes) and the tables are too crammed together, but I'll definitely come back here again for the delicious brisket !"
358609,2013-12-22,920,104360,0,3,Ok the food is good so would warrant a solid 4 stars. The ribs are great. However 1 star deducted due to (a) 1 hour 30 minute wait for the food. (b) the restaurant stated Delivery dot Com caused 20 minutes of that delay (I believe them we have had issues before) - but 1 hour 10 minutes is still a bit slow for delivery.  Hope they get that sorted!
358610,2013-12-21,920,160993,0,5,"Been there at least a dozen times in the last year....never disappointed, actually, the restaurant keeps getting better and better! I love the new sit down table service model. It's nice to be waited on by the friendly and attentive servers. I've tried many new menu items as they were added....love pork ribs, mac and cheese(new) and corn bread. But of course the winner hands down....combo of lean and fatty brisket...just incredible...melts in your mouth with a smooth peppery kick. Each time I visit with new friends, theres always a new item to try which makes us anticipate the goodness to come. We've also sampled many new wines on their expanding wine and beer menu. Always try to save room for dessert.....amazing! Thanks Delaney BBQ for brightening up our neighborhod....we'll be back!"
358611,2013-12-15,920,60527,0,5,"Love. We showed up when they opened at 11 on a Saturday- we were the only ones in there while we ordered, ate and left. The service was fantastic- they were super sweet to us. Everything on the menu was available and no wait! LOVED the meat: fatty brisket, pork ribs, and a hot link. The ribs are a little different from Fette Sau, almost like pastrami but really meaty and delicious. The brisket was phenomenal- though I like Mighty Quinn's better. I thought the sides were fantastic, though- the potato salad and wedge salad were a great complement to the barbecue. So glad we made it here."
358612,2013-12-14,920,2808,0,4,"Went here on a cold Sunday for a quick bite. Living in Texas and Chicago most of my life and winning amateur BBQ competitions gives me a little credibility in judging BBQ joints. I spoke to the owner and he said that he trained under Aaron Franklin in Austin, Texas who has the best brisket you can find. I happen to know him as casually through other friends. When I asked him specific questions, the owner didn't answer them. I hope he isn't using Franklins name for extra business . He seemed a little uncomfortable speaking to me, like most hipsters who are scared of different people. Hint hint. Just kidding. I digress. The waitress was as snarky as can be but we enjoyed her humor. The  cornbread that came out was delicious. We had the brisket and it was probably the best in NYC when Fette Sau and Hill Country are not on their game. A little too fatty but delicious. The winner was the pulled pork though. Best I've had hands down. Blows Carolina places away. The sausage was good too. Great White bread like they serve at Texas BBQ joints. They have shiner beer too which is a plus. Overall, I'll return. I loved the food but not the vibe of the place. I hope the owner is telling the truth about Franklin or he'll lose credibility. As a matter of fact, I'll confirm with Aaron myself when I'm in Austin in 2 weeks. Not to bust his bubble again but I thought that restaurants in NYC as a whole weren't allowed to have outdoor smokers but this place claims to smoke their meat on an outdoor pit."
358613,2013-12-12,920,15326,0,5,"Dan Delaney found a way to make this place have the best tasting BBQ in New York in my opinion. The ribs are top notch along with the brisket of course. The all you can eat pickles, onions and bread is really good too! Sounds like simple stuff but it's really good with all this meat! I've been following Delaney since his days reviewing street food and starting Vendr.TV and he is usually right about all he says so it's no wonder why this place would also be perfect and it's his own!"
358614,2013-11-30,920,160994,0,5,"Brisket was incredible, cornbread with honey butter was outta this world, and design/aesthetic was great. Go now."
358615,2013-11-27,920,121044,0,2,"Just finished a meal here and the service was almost laughable. There were only about 4 tables full when we entered and it took about ten minutes for one of the waiters to approach our table. No eye contact, no water, no silverware when the food arrived, etc. we asked for water twice and had to really push for that refreshing drink to be brought to us. I would look up and try to make eye contact with one of the waiters who was simply staring straight ahead at space? The food was Ok, I would give it a 3, not that special, Fette Sau is just as good, if not better, but the service here was just ridiculous (did I say that already?) and it seemed as if they were overwhelmed by just the thought of service. We also asked for a doggy bag that never arrived. Briskettown? More like wait an hour for mediocre barbecue village."
358616,2013-11-24,920,160995,0,5,"Best brisket I've had in NYC. Hands down. Now if you're looking for a BBQ place where your entrees are slathered in sauce and you have 45 entrees to choose from, this isn't the place for you. But if you are looking for beautifully smoked meats with well balanced sides then Welcome home! Plus, you get a FREE HALF POUND OF MEAT ON YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!FREE!!! Yes, the wait was lengthy. Yes, they don't take reservations. Yes, the space is small. But one taste of the smoky, fatty, juicy, so tender you can cut it with a fork brisket will shut you up. To me, the pulled pork was sadly forgettable, but the free potato bread and sweet pickles made it for it. My experience on a Saturday night was an hour wait for a table for 2, but the owner was apologetic and kind enough to comp our drinks for the wait (that's how you KEEP customers!). Definitely coming back."
358617,2013-11-24,920,8017,0,2,"I enjoyed this spot, despite my story. Was here with a big party for a birthday celebration. Brisket was on point, and I'm a veggie. I figure when in Rome, do as the Romans do.  We thought it needed sauce at first but we kept eating it and said 'Eff the sauce, this is good.' You can't go to Briskettown and not get brisket... Well, you can. My first choice was the beef ribs, which they were conveniently out of  -_- Fatal-fatal error on their part: There pumpkin pie has nuts in it. In the crust. I've never encountered pumpkin pie with nuts but now I know to ask on THAT now. Definitely a life lesson. Glad I got to learn the lesson since it didn't take my life... How do I know it had nuts? I'm deathly allergic and had a horrible reaction. It wasn't pretty. They need to put that on their menu. So unfortunately my whole lovely dinner went violently into the toilet 20 min later. Yes, violently. TMI? Well, it is what it is. Proves a point. Think it's gross? Deal with it. We're all human. Minus 3 stars for no disclaimer and incorrect info. If this didn't occur, easily 4 stars total. Awesome place. Our server was blah though. It took entirely too long for one course of our dinner to come. And it took a while to get my pre meal wine. But the lovely gal at the bar apologized. I'll go back but I will steer FAR AWAY from that pumpkin pie. A shame though cause it was good until I reacted & lost my meal.  Upside to it all? Found a great spot and lost 3 lbs. *whoop whoop*"
358618,2013-11-24,920,4965,0,5,"No Sauce Needed!!! This should be posted with a big sign somewhere in this restaurant, why would I need a sauce to hide the smokey goodness of this wonderful BBQ. Dam the brisket had a fine fatty top with a moist slice of meat hanging underneath this succulent goodness. The ribs were delicious too but my choice would be the brisket. Oh the peppery flavor and just the attention of hours of slow cooking makes the meat so tender. The potato salad was good, wish they add a macaroni and cheese.. Really just a happy camper! I shall return dam it, and I hope it is soon."
358619,2013-11-23,920,160996,0,4,"The brisket was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best I have ever tasted. The greens were great as well, if you like vinegar-based foods. It was different, but different in a good way. Everything else was just okay. They do need barbecue sauce for the other items as it just doesn't taste like anything. Overall I would go back for the brisket  and the collard greens. Umm, umm good...."
358620,2013-11-18,920,68969,0,1,"Disappointing.  Decided to give it another try since the food was good on our first visit.     And I had been getting updates from the owners via email that they got even better brisket. What a disappointment.  The pulled pork did not have the authentic smoked BBQ taste.  Seemed like it was boiled and the brisket lacked flavor.  Plus we were there around 6 pm on Saturday and they were out of ribs and sausage so they only had pork and brisket.  They also changed the counter service. Now is sit down service, which I usually prefer.   Well service would not be the word I use.  It took over 30 min to get out food and no one checked on us during that time. At the end the server mentioned that ""oh sorry your food took so long"" but by than it was too late.  Sorry Delancy you are not a BBQ place for this Longhorn girl!!!!  Bring back your previous brisket recipe and counter service!!!!"
358621,2013-11-16,920,160997,0,4,"First time going here was last night at their year anniversary and the atmosphere was awesome. The live band was fun and entertaining. Went here expecting the brisket to be really good and it was, no complaints at all. The pulled pork, was okay. Now that being said the surprises were the sausage, potato salad and red chilli. Oh and the coconut custard pie. All of which were phenomenal. Highly recommend this place and will 100% be going back. Think I found my go to BBQ joint. No XL t-shirts either, only XXL and XXXL. Guess I'll have to make more trips back to fit into one of those."
358622,2013-11-12,920,15061,0,4,"When you think of quality barbecue, you may instinctively scoff at the idea of a Williamsburg hipster joint. But Delaney BBQ Briskettown is here to prove you wrong. Ordering the Meatfest Platter for two, the tray arrived, laden with every meaty offering they had, along with their collard greens and potato salad. As much as I lament the idea of potato salad making my meal heavier, this was the lightest and tastiest potato salad I've ever had. The combination of spices in this complimented the meat so well, that I finished the salad before I got through 3/4 of the meat. The collard greens were sour and decent, but not the best I've had. Onto the meat: The pork ribs were so impressively executed--moist and fall off the bone. These ribs rival those I've eaten in Texas. The brisket was good and partly moist, yet I found outer sections of the brisket to be a bit dry. Not 100% recommended. Pulled pork and bbq pulled pork - preferred the pulled pork over the BBQ pulled pork, which was a little too salty. Both were fairly decent. Beef ribs- tender, juicy, and fit for a king. Second to the pork ribs, but so worth a try. Sausage links - very tasty and I enjoyed these, but nothing too special. Everything about this place says Hipster Williamsburg, but the way they dole out this heavenly barbecued meat is right on the money! There is absolutely nothing better than smoked meat served to you on brown paper, and BrisketTown is here to prove that."
358623,2013-11-03,920,50846,0,4,"Good brisket place. Has free white sandwich bread, sliced pickles (much much better than most american pickles - good mix of sweet and sour, with good texture) , and onions. Rub is peppery, good flavor, everything is smoky but not too much. Good black bark on everything. Went twice. Would be 5 stars for first visit and 4 stars for second.... Once on a weekday evening (when they were between liquor licenses, so lines were short). Ordered: Ribs -- fall off the bone, delicious. strong smoke ring. Fatty brisket -- full of flavour, wonderful texture, but very fatty. Lean brisket -- also good, but kind of lean. Not tough, but not as marbled as the fatty (true by definition I guess) Once on a weekend afternoon, only had lean brisket."
358624,2013-10-27,920,58103,0,4,"Oh god I just looked at the photos I took of my amazing meal there last week and now I'm depressed since I live all the way in Hawaii and it'll cost me no less than a grand just to make my way back to this slice of heaven! My BF loves brisket so as soon as we woke on Saturday (which was like at 1pm), we excitedly made our way to BrisketTown. We get there and they're out of meat but we're told the driver is on his way with the delivery; we're asked if we want to wait about 15 minutes. Oh hell yes! However, the bad news was that they were out of brisket. My BF shed a couple tears but got over it. The group of guys that came in about 10 minutes after us exclaimed: ""No brisket at BrisketTown?!!"" They got over it too because they also stayed to eat. While we waited we were given complimentary chili with a couple slices of the fluffiest white bread I've ever had. The chili was flavorful, smokey and a chunky mix of brisket and pulled pork. I will never eat chili with ground beef and beans again! Soon enough our order of pulled pork, sausage, collards, potato salad and Texas caviar arrived. I silently stuffed my face knowing I may not eat meat this delicious again for some time. I'm already saving money for my next visit and this time I'll be wise enough to call ahead to reserve brisket and save room for pie!"
358625,2013-10-27,920,17624,0,1,"I did go due to the hype, but I was not prepared at all for my experience. The brisket is OK. Against my better judgement I ordered a not so fatty cut and a fatty cut. The fatty cuts of brisket were pretty good, but not any better than Fette Sau or any other decent place. The non-fatty parts... really, why bother? That being said, the brisket is decent. It needs sauce, though. I know the owner is against the idea of sauce, but despite it's meaty flavor, it just needs another salt/sweet/tart component. That would have made it delicious. Either way, let me start from the beginning. I knew that this place got pretty full, so I was sure to go before they opened. That being said, I got there 15 or so minutes before and encountered a line. That was fine and it wasn't too long, although there were 10 or so people ahead of me. I got to the place and made sure that I put my name down. The first thing they asked was, ""did you pre-order your brisket?"" Really? Apparently you can call and reserve to get there before the restaurant opens. They don't say this on their website, but this is ridiculous. All of us normal patrons waited outside until the restaurant opened. When they opened, there were still people eating inside... so that meant they started to trickle in the normal patrons after those people left. There was a line outside for people waiting to get in. Once you're done with that line, there is another internal line before you get your table. There was only one person dealing with the cutting. The menu was positioned in a way where you only knew what your options are once you got up front. The whole process was so INEFFICIENT. Once we got inside, we waited on the last line and that took 40+ minutes. The outside line took around 20-30 minutes. Overall during the entire time there we spotted at least 2 tables that seat 4 people open at all times. They are clearly not managing the flow of people. Once you get up front and order, you get to take unlimited pieces of bread. We also didn't have any problem sitting down after waiting for over an hour. (After getting to the restaurant 15 minutes before open time.) For ALL that, the food was mediocre. I might wait over an hour for Ippudo (and the last time I did that, that was no longer transcendent either), but not this mediocre brisket. They should institute more of a Fette Sau policy in letting people find their own tables instead of a host not letting people in from outside. The table management left A LOT to be desired."
358626,2013-10-27,920,98685,0,2,"We went Friday arriving a little after 5pm, when it opened.The place was empty, my lady friend and I both ordered the TEXACASE Sampler and I ordered chili at the advice of the hostess (who was friendly and very pleasant)  to  TAKE AWAY. We live in Manhattan, I didn't check the bag until I arrived home only to discover I had no sides. Calling Brisket Town I was told the chef put  the sides in one container, why when it was TWO separate orders on different checks? . I wasn't pleased that I had no sides and I really wasn't as pleased as others by the meats but the Chili was EXCELLENT, I must say. I am a Fette Sau man,they have nothing to worry about.Matter of fact I think I'll pay them a visit next week. I was very disappointed especially because of all the praise on these pages."
358627,2013-10-21,920,160998,0,1,"I don't believe that I have ever left a barbecue joint confused and unsatisfied, but I did last night after eating here. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered pork, beef brisket, and greens. The greens are vegetarian and had a slimy taste. I'm from the south, and this was NOT how you do collard greens... The pork was very fatty, but not bad. The beef brisket was incredibly dry, and there are no sauces to help. That may be acceptable if you are served water. The glasses are shot glasses, and our waiter was so awful/slow, we ended up grabbing carafes ourselves TWICE because they wouldn't acknowledge us. (The food is so salty, we were desperate!)The food is also served family style, which we were not warned and since all 4 of us ordered different amounts of meat, we were not happy. I think this is a place you order take out from, but never eat at. Personally, I'd never pay that much for this food again. Overpriced and not worth it.  Don't say I didn't warn you."
358628,2013-10-18,920,65690,0,5,"Wowo. This place is awesome. Went with my boyfriend around 7pm and there was an hour or so wait. We put our names down went next door for a beer and came back around 8ish. At that time the sign on the door said ""sold out"" we were like what? But apparently since we were on the waitlist we were able to get brisket. ...omg delish. I have never ever had brisket this good before. So much flavor and a very limited side dishes. I would definitely go here again. I think it pretty reasonably priced too."

358630,2013-10-13,920,42884,0,4,"you know how some neighborhoods just do certain kinds of food really well?   i feel like williamsburg is creating it's own little niche for delicious bbq.  we have mable's smokehouse, fette sau, good company, fatty 'cue and now a newcomer; briskettown.  we stopped in to check it out early on a sunday evening and fell in love with the simple menu, bold flavors and well, cheap beer.  here's the deal, you walk in, grab a table, place your order in the back and then grab your drinks from the bar.  you even get to select your own accoutrements to pair with your brisket.  there are piles of white bread, sweet pickles, pickled onions and crystal hot sauce (all necessary).   we did some brisket (lean and fatty) some ribs, collard greens and a side of chili.  for two of us, this was more than enough.  it was all very, very delicious though.  smokey, spicy, tender...  just plain good! briskettown is small so i'd recommend you get there early.  go hungry too!"
358631,2013-10-13,920,14029,0,5,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's basically what went through my head after the first taste of BrisketTown's namesake meat. Marbled. Luscious. Smoky. Bark like a redwood tree. The undisputed king of NYC brisket, which is actually saying a lot these days. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's basically what went through my head after my first taste of Briskettown's pork ribs. Very moist, but not falling apart. Dark pink smoke ring. And again, that thick black bark. Absolutely textbook. Sides were very good, if not quite as life-changing. Adored the sweet housemade pickles, and the tart bean salad was also pleasant, but the collards, while more than respectable, had a really robust broth that I found overwhelming. If I ever move to Williamsburg, this restaurant will be a key reason why. P.S. While I like the low-key ambiance, might be a good idea to get some tunes going and make things just a little less mellow."
358632,2013-10-04,920,7416,0,5,"Delaney can do no wrong with meat. Came on a Saturday night with a group of 5. Was seated pretty quickly- was not as busy as we anticipated. Everyone got brisket and a couple of us got pork rib, and shared 1 lb of beef rib.  For the brisket, you have a choice of lean or moist- all of us went with moist.  Delicious, melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The crust on the brisket is super thick and peppery. It seems that everyone loved their pork ribs.  The beef rib is gigantic and 1 portion is roughly a pound.  We split that between everyone so we'd all get a taste.  It's very...oily.  Probably not my favorite, but, can't blame meat for being succulent, right?   You are welcome to help yourself to white bread, onions, and pickles on the side.  I'm not a huge pickle fan, but I do love onions, and I wish they were pickled instead of raw, though the rawness counters the fattiness quite well.  Some eat their meat plain, but I feel like you def. need a vessel for the brisket.   Service is very relaxed, friendly.  At the end of your meal, you should be proactive about asking about the check, and bringing your payment to the counter, or you'll be sitting there for a while.  Would def. be back for more meat, or stop by the outlet on the Highline."
358633,2013-10-03,920,7212,0,5,"Daniel is going to be mad at me when I say this, but I BRING MY OWN sauce. I know it doesnt need sauce, but I am such a BBQ sauce lover that it makes this place my favorite BBQ place ever after I add my own paleo GF sauce. Service is always great. The people who cut the meat are super helpful and friendly. The bartender in the front always likes to have a nice conversation with you when you are eating, and the german potato salad is like WOAH! Luckily I live close by so its only a bike ride away ;)"
358634,2013-09-19,920,25007,0,4,Great BBQ place...I would say this place is better than fette sau. The only complaint I have is that the place is too small.
358635,2013-09-14,920,161000,0,5,Wow!!!! The brisket is amazing. Awesome staff and atmosphere! And if you have enough room after stuffing your face with beef save room for the homemade pies and a couple of IPA's .....absolutely incredible!
358636,2013-09-14,920,3058,0,3,I was unimpressed and disappointed. I have been dying to try it because I love brisket. The peppery crust to the fatty juices that coat every nook and cranny of your mouth. I guess my expectations were too high. I assumed with the name I would be blown away. It was a light breeze. It had the usual marks of a good brisket but some how it still a bit under seasoned and not juicy enough.
358637,2013-09-09,920,44015,0,4,"Great place!  We came in a bit early (12pm'ish) and there was only brisket available (as far as meat was concerned) so we had that while there.  They were nice and there was sides such as potato salad which is delicious especially topped with scallions that they out on top.  I didn't taste the collared greens but the chili was good, (very spicy) but good.  We waited until around 1:30pm for the ribs to be bought in and man were they worth the wait.  It seems (and maybe I'm wrong) that the peppery brisket rub was mixed with sugar and used on the ribs.  They have beef and pork but since we had the brisket we got the pork ribs.  Its family friendly and can accommodate a couple of large groups (not more than 6-10 people I would say).   Todd (the guy that served us slices of meat heaven) was just awesome!  He was so accommodating, generous and just all around helpful and sweet. I like how everything seemed strategically placed and decorated.  I would definitely eat here again with no problem.  A bit pricey but not too bad considering the quality and what other places are charging.  Really good grub with a nice little $3 beer happy hour (12-6pm)"
358638,2013-09-03,920,11413,0,3,"I love this place. This review is long overdue. The brisket is amazing obviously as I would hope given the name of the establishment. Then why the three stars? The discontinuing of the taco service. Imagine this scenario. You create something truly amazing. A food item everyone wants, it is better than the stupid cronut, and then all of a sudden after you have been written about in national blogs, magazines, etc. as one of the most delectable bites in America!!!! You stop! Simply because it takes too much time to ""switch stations from breakfast to lunch, about two hours"". That it may be but that doesn't make me a happy camper. Hire someone to come in early and do breakfast service perhaps? Whoever decided to eliminate the tacos and breakfast sandwiches... SHAME!"
358639,2013-09-02,920,12275,0,4,"Very similar to the oh-so-popular fette sau (less than a mile away). The brisket here is definitely better than what's offered at Fette Sau. I definitely appreciated the unlimited bread, pickles and onion. I would definitely come here for lunch on a weekend and to have a few beers. The service at this location was excellent. You pay for the meat by the pound. I'd say ordering a half a pound of meat per person is more than enough."
358640,2013-08-21,920,62101,0,5,Best Brisket I've ever had? Easily... I was taken here by a friend on a Saturday night and luckily they had already sold out. I say luckily because we were still determined to try the Brisket so we came back the next morning in search of their Brisket Tacos. It turns out that they discontinued the taco service (Which was pissing people around us that morning and I'm sure will continue to do so...) BUT on certain mornings they have Brisket Bagel Sandwiches. We were lucky enough to get one of these $12 beasts and it was well worth the double trip. I plan on coming back for a lunch/dinner experience.

358642,2013-08-14,920,28022,0,5,"Everything here is the best I've ever had. Best BBQ, best free/unlimited pickles, best speedy service, best free koozie with beer purchase. Go here immediately."
358643,2013-08-10,920,32895,0,3,"BrisketTown, at $25 for a pound of brisket was rather pricey for the amount you get and also for the divey atmosphere of the place. The brisket was nice, but nothing mind-blowing to me--I think it could have been more tender. What I really enjoyed were the sides (we got collard greens and potato salad, a great accompaniment to the brisket, and I'm not sure I would have been full without the sides). The beer selection isn't bad and our server was very friendly. While I liked the food, it didn't stand out to me, so I don't have any great desire to come back."
358644,2013-08-08,920,4585,0,4,"It's tough making big bucks  in the ""Smoked Brisket"" business.  Just one visit on a Tuesday after noon about 2 pm with me as the only patron there is evidence. But those that those that do go head to head with the toughest  piece of meat of the cow have a true passion for it, as it is science, skill, and art all mixed in a complex weave that doesn't seem to be precise and yet the goal of consistency is the greatest challenge. Brisket 'Town / Delaney makes a valiant effort and achieves something incredibly remarkable. My comparison is based on many of the standards  and ""litmus tests"" set in central Texas. While I am not a huge fan of the flavor of Brisket Town's Brisket.   It nevertheless has one aspect achieved and hard to come by; the ""Bark"" (crust). This is the ""gold"" element of the brisket and most places, for whatever reason, cannot offer it. I could eat this ""Bark"" as a meal only all day long; it's that good."
358645,2013-08-04,920,16438,0,4,Wow the brisket is absolutely phenomenal! So was the wedge salad. There are just a few things missing...........more side options and some barbeque sauces!
358646,2013-08-03,920,116477,0,5,"What's beef? Beef is making mouth watering brisket for me to eat. Beef is when I see you.....Beef is when I see you. And by you, I mean Delaney's Briskettown. Everything about this place is on point. The Food? Check. The Atmosphere? Check. Awesome people? Check. Did I mention the Food? Discount double check. I remember my friend putting me on to this place. I was kind of a skeptic but that's my natural inclination about things. However, she knows her food so I truss it. I reserved my meat (nh) and hoped for the best. Been here a couple times, once with group of 4 people and once by my lonesome. Both times that I came here, I was extremely pleased with my total experience. The brisket here is to die for. It's is everything you want in a brisket. It looks sexy. It's taste's amazing. It's juicy but not soggy. And it makes your mouth feel wonderful. I'm thinking about it right now and it brings tears to my eyes. This is the ""Cindy Crawford in her prime"" of brisket. I would sacrifice my first born for a chance......A CHANCE!!!....to have a lifetime supply of this stuff. The pickles are juicy and oh so good. Oh my. I tried some of their homemade pasta too and that was dank as well. These people know what they are doing. And they are doing it to perfection. I cannot wait to go back and try the Brisket 3.0 (does the OMG I LOVE BRISKET dance). The atmosphere of this place is awesome. It's everything that I'd expect a BBQ joint to look like....complete with a flashing neon sign shaped like a cow that says Delaney's Briskettown. The people in here are terrific. The service is uncanny and they are down for some witty banter if you have it in you. This one girl with short hair and glasses that worked behind the bar was especially outstanding. One time I walked in there by myself and she occupied my time with conversation about great pizza places (she recommended Best Pizza to me because she felt like I was the type to love it), her strategy of how she'd eat brisket (which I have now adopted as my own), and texting etiquette. One of the coolest ladies I've ever met. There is one problem I have with the place. I've heard rumors of pork ribs being served here. Being a man of Halal dietary restrictions, I'm hoping...no, I'm praying that they eventually have beef ribs at some point. I will be indebted to the Delaney faction for the rest of my life if this happens. Delaney is BBQ Jesus. And this place belongs in the pantheon of BBQ joints in NYC. I wish I were able to shake the man's hand himself. He has created himself an institution in my humble opinion. If they were to make a Mount Rushmore of BBQ, they should reserve a spot for Delaney."
358647,2013-07-31,920,6766,0,5,"I have read about brisket like this and seen it on TV, but I have never had it before. It was amazing. Perfect char on the outside and juice and tender on the inside."
358648,2013-07-28,920,31489,0,4,"Everything was juicy and tender, the fat just melts in your mouth, and amazing flavor combinations in the dry rub. If I lived in the area I would definitely frequent this place!"
358649,2013-07-23,920,82050,0,3,"Food - Meats -brisket probably best I have had. Spices, charring, juiciness - PERFECT -pork ribs in top 15 -beef ribs - short of mark. High on moisture/juiciness, low on flavor Food - Sides -potato salad - a little salty for my liking -bean salad (Texas caviar) - pretty good. Nice light complement to fatty meats -collard greens - good, juicy, tender -potato chips - a bag of deli chips - are you kidding me? Service -OK for a sandwich deli, but poor in this context (when we were there, the bartender's priority seemed to be training newbies) Except for the brisket, which was truly mind blowing, place is over priced for the quality of other menu items $3-5 a side for a small ice cream cup size portion of something which I could whip up in my kitchen is not endearing Similarly, $6 for a lukewarm can of beer served in the can doesn't add up for me."
358650,2013-07-18,920,24628,0,5,"Stumbled in by accident around 5pm to escape sweltering heat and have a craft beer at the small bar up front... After a few watermelon wheats and some random conversation with the genuine staff, hunger arose... The barmaid giggled when we asked if the food was good here... A confident, intriguing giggle. On a trip to the boys room I noticed the one early table that was eating, enjoying a plate of some type of ribs... I sent my buddy up to the counter to order those ribs... He came back with a generous tray of brisket and pork ribs and potato salad... Upon biting into the ""central texas"" dry rubbed brisket, I cringed... A good cringe, as this was the most succulent, tasty piece of meat I can recall ingesting... OMG, ""like butter"", I kept repeating... Absolutely delicious, as were the pork ribs... The crispy crusty spiced rub was perfect and the meat just melted in your mouth without the mess of a sloppy saturating sweet sauce... What a find this place was....... Stellar and will be craving daily...... Had a nice Washington cab with the meat too!...... bravo Delaney BBQ or Briskettown or whatever your called !!......Don't dumb down, you crazy mixed up kids!!"
358651,2013-07-18,920,25274,0,4,"If delicious barbecue brisket is what you are after, this is the place!!! Get the moist. Its ridiculous good. They have pickles, onions and sliced martin potato bread to help yourself to. The potato salad i had was OK. Plenty of seating and on a hot summer day the place was nice and cool. Brisket is what this place is all about!!"
358652,2013-07-17,920,89239,0,4,Some of the most awesome BBQ that I've had outside of Texas. It was a good experience with great food. Best part was the authenticity of the BBQ in the middle of NYC.
358653,2013-07-16,920,1118,0,5,"I swear, I have never had a bad time here. The meat is always cardiac-tastic and the staff is always sweet as pie. Great, GREAT place to visit in Williamsburg and grab a drink or a meal. I always bring home extra because the brisket is phenomenal! And the pork ribs fall off the bone. Literally."
358654,2013-07-14,920,161001,0,5,"I am a Native Texan, and when I first heard of Briskettown, I could't wait for it to open!  I drove from Ridgewood, NJ to Williamsburg, I was so excited.  It did not disappoint.  I felt like I was back in Texas.  From the delicious beef right down to the incredibly friendly staff.  It has such a laid back atmosphere, and everything is, as we say in Texas, ""Slap yo momma good"".  I have recommended it to fellow Texan friends in the city, and they love it too!  I can't wait to go back soon...perhaps this week!"
358655,2013-07-12,920,2441,0,4,"SO GOOD. A bit out of the way, and perhaps a little pricey for the atmosphere, but totally delicious. Brisket/ribs/other goodness by the lb, awesome sides. At the time it was still BYOB so we got a six of SBock on the way in to make the whole thing legit. I think that was on the outs though. Brisket was just perfect. Perfect. Will totally be back."
358656,2013-07-09,920,3917,0,4,"Great BBQ joint! Menu changes daily. We had the ""pulled bacon"",  biscuit, beet slaw, rosemary potatoes, pork ribs, and brisket! The brisket, biscuit, beet slaw and rosemary potatoes were great! the ""pulled bacon"" was good but a little too salty for our tastes, ribs were decent but the byob and the great complimentary pickles and onions make this place a definite must! One of my top 5 BBQ joints in NYC!"
358657,2013-07-05,920,21555,0,4,"Not as good as the first time I had the brisket when Delaney was doing brisket lab, but still the best brisket around town. I don't know if he lets the meat sit a bit longer now, but I've noticed it tastes a but drier than the first time I had brisket lab brisket, which was so flavorful, melt in your mouth, slap your momma good. THAT GOOD. It was 96 degrees the day I had brisket lab and I still can remember the flavor of that brisket steaming out of my body that day. Who needs deodorant when you have brisket? Tried the pork ribs for the first time. They were too salty. Wouldn't get them again. Texas cavier and potato salad also great compliments to break up the richness of the meat. Can't wait to come back!!"
358658,2013-07-04,920,34479,0,3,"Amazing ribs and perfect quality meat on the brisket side of things. However they make a serious error in not offering barbecue sauce for the brisket. Yes, this is a BBQ place that shuns barbecue sauce. Like... really? Dry rub is fine and often preferred for ribs, but brisket often benefits from the sweet-vinegary flavor of a good sauce, especially if you like your meat lean. I would probably not go back for that reason, as there are many other excellent BBQ restaurants in NY that do make their own homemade delicious sauces (Mighty Quinn's brisket is just as good AND you have the option of sauce). Also highly non-sensical since the place does have a variety of the usual hot sauces."
358659,2013-07-03,920,29399,0,5,"Can't really complain about this spot. I walked in around 6:30pm, ordered a couple Shiner's ($5) then some Pork Rib + Brisket with side orders of Potato Salad + Texas Caviar for a total of $30. When I sat down I didn't think it was going to be enough food, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish everything either. The Brisket was by far the best thing I've had in months. It literally was cut by a plastic fork at first then with my fingers because I thought the fork took too long to eat it with. I would simply slap that brisket on some white bread and go to town. Perfection. The Pork Ribs were delicious as well, but that brisket is really where it's at. As far as sides go, the Potato Salad and Texas Caviar are both nothing to skip. The texas caviar has a great deal of cilantro in it that give it a very light, tangy taste, which I enjoy, so it was perfect. The potato salad was some of the best I've had ever. I wanted to go with the Beef Rib because of how delicious it looked, but for only two people, that thing makes you look like a Flintstone. I will try my hardest to get back for it one day though. All around great spot. Lack of seating, but get there early anyway. While I was standing by the door, an employee was placing a sign on the door stating they were ""sold out"" and it was only 8pm...on a Tuesday."
358660,2013-07-03,920,2360,0,5,"Best Barbecue in New York. No question. Hands down. Mr. Delaney (who actually was serving at the bar the last time I was there) is a genius. Even having been to Big Apple BBQ Block Party and trying barbecue from all over the country, this is the place to go. Walk in with a couple friends and order about half to a full pound of meat per person, but of all the options. Personally, the pork ribs are the best. What amazing peppery bark is on those ribs. For most, this place is all about the brisket, which is surely the best in NYC. Fatty, tender, peppery, perfect. Their huge beef rib is also a much try, at least to see meat torn off that huge bone (which they actually use as the door handle to the restroom). One thing I've noticed is poor sides at some barbecue joints, not this place. Best collard greens and potato salad I've had. The beans with meat, can't go wrong. Another wonderful thing is that after you order, you walk over to a station to help yourself to slice of thick cut potato bread, pickled peppers and onions, paper towels, and Crystal's hot sauce. Grab everything as you'll need. Then sit down, throw some peppers and onions on that bread, a slab of brisket, shake some hot sauce on, fold that thing, and enjoy your mouthgasm. Oh, did I mention how good of a deal this all is? I went with 4 friends, we walked away paying $14 each! For world class barbecue! In New York! I can come back to this place every week. Just go already."
358661,2013-06-30,920,161002,0,5,"Unbelievable brisket!  Like from another planet!  The ribs and the sausage are great, but the brisket is absolutely phenomenal.  Must be experienced."
358662,2013-06-23,920,10079,0,3,Stopped in for lunch and ordered the breakfast taco which was quite good. I also got a slice of the strawberry rhubarb pie which was awesome as well. There was no line and no waiting for tables for us. Service was efficient and friendly. This is a no frills type of place with a simple menu but great flavored dishes.
358663,2013-06-19,920,1081,0,4,"Came here for lunch and had the brisket sandwich.  It's very legit, super tender brisket but I don't think they give you nearly enough meat to justify the price of a $10 sandwich."
358664,2013-06-16,920,5453,0,5,"Wow wow wow.  Hands down the BEST Brisket in NYC.  While the sandwiches are good, to get the true flavor of their meat, you MUST go for dinner and have their brisket platters where the brisket is sliced and not chopped. Its wet, juicy and bursting with flavor. There are only a few things on the menu and there's not much of a vibe but the food is heavenly and why would you need more dishes when you've perfectly one as well as these guys.   We had the Brisket with german potatoes which I LOVED.   Don't even think about it.  If you like brisket, this is a place that you MUST try AND yes it IS worth the trek over the Manhattan bridge especially with a Citibike."
358665,2013-06-11,920,45521,0,1,"I've downgraded my rating because the owner sent me a message and I sent a reply, but he never responded.  What good is offering a ""make-up"" meal if you're not going to reply and honor it?  Not nice."
358666,2013-06-07,920,1580,0,5,"What do you do after a day at Six Flags...why, you go to BrisketTown! So, it was a quiet Wednesday night about a half hour before close. There's reclaimed wood everywhere, which is just the vibe I like for BBQ. There are booths and chairs lining either side of the dining area and a little area that corral you into a line to the ordering counter. There the menu is written on white butcher paper hanging on a giant clipboard. Sidenote: when you walk in, you encounter their merchandise counter... We ordered lean brisket, fatty brisket, pork ribs and potato salad. So here's my rundown: lean brisket - awesome, black pepper rub fatty brisket - deliciously fatty, but not overly so, lots of flavor pork ribs - super tender, comes off the bone, but doesn't fall apart, tons of meat potato salad - awesome flavor, by far my favorite potato salad in williamsburg The food was delicious and filling. Small menu, but only makes the decisions slightly easier. After you've gotten your food...you head over to the condiments counter which has onions, pickles, hot sauces (Tabasco and Crystal), potato bread slices, and rolls and rolls of paper towels. Sit down and you're ready to go!"
358667,2013-06-06,920,70330,0,1,"To update my previously glowing review, I went in to get one of those two amazing sandwiches for lunch, and I noticed that they had raised the price from $6 to $10 for the sandwiches. Keep in mind that is only for the sandwich and it does not come with any side(s). I have heard of raising prices, but to do a $4 price increase on just a sandwich?! It's bbq, it not supposed to be pretentious or overly expensive! What a shame."
358668,2013-06-03,920,1987,0,4,"Who knew Brooklyn would become the destination for barbecue? Delaney is just a few blocks away from Fette Sau so I decided to conduct my own Brooklyn barbecue showdown. BBQ: I ordered the brisket sandwich because hell, it's in the name, and I am from Texas where we are the undisputed kings of barbecue brisket and will shoot you and take away your healthcare if you say otherwise. Said brisket came on a hamburger-type bun with pickles and raw onion. Not how I would serve it, but I have no complaints. I prefer my brisket shredded or thinly sliced; Delaney serves it cut into small chunks. Again, not what I would do, but it was unobjectionable. Properly cooked, but maybe a little dry and lacking in smoke flavor. I did not see sauce around but I didn't ask so maybe they have it. AMBIENCE: It looks like a barbecue place. Wooden benches, a large bovine sign, rustic soda bottles and crates. Neither fancy nor expensive, as all good barbecue joints should be. Friendly staff, no music. OTHER: They have pie! I didn't try any as I was saving room for the barbecue showdown, but pie is a beautiful thing. No license as of yet."
358669,2013-05-30,920,7372,0,5,"Preface/background: I am now more focused on quality and am always looking for a great deal (read: value). Less meat, no more 2 Chipotle burrito eating. Tried everything on the menu - beef brisket, beef short rib, and pork rib. Hands down, the pork rib is amazing, and earns this place a 5. The beef short rib and brisket are OK. I would probably give those a 3 or a 3.5 at max. The ribs are so soft and the meat just falls off the bone, and it's not drenched in sauce like most other ribs are. The true flavor of the pork comes out, and it's delicious. So it's almost a purist's approach to ribs - extracting natural flavors and getting it to taste how it was meant to taste. The sides are ok - potato salad and collard greens are good. The beans have too much meat in them - I would've appreciated just pure beans instead of beans with meat in them. They also have a station of unlimited potato bread, raw onions, and pickles. This is a must-eat if you are in New York City. I'm no BBQ expert, but the ribs here are the best I've ever had. Come here just for the ribs and you won't be disappointed."
358670,2013-05-30,920,113519,0,5,"I came here once and had just the best time. It's a little strange to me, the way things are done. Instead of ordering ""brisket and a side of potato salad,"" and them giving you a plate, you have to order by the pound. I imagine the people working there have to explain that to people all the time. The woman who served me was Maggie, and she was just super sweet and helpful. She made helpful suggestions and showed me how much an individual portion is. I needed that too because I was absolutely lost and I think she could tell. I'd have to say even if the brisket wasn't great, she and Heather, the other woman working, have gotten the place 5 stars. They were wonderful. We chatted a bit, and they made me really feel welcome. That being said, the brisket was fantastic. Just splendid. Tender, moist, and the peppercorn on the outside was great! The pork Ribs, potato salad and Strawberry Rhubarb pie were just as good... well, nothing could touch that brisket, but all that other stuff was still great. If you ever just want some good meat, this is the spot."
358671,2013-05-29,920,112378,0,5,The food is delicious. The meat falls right off of the bones on the pork ribs.Normally I am not a fan of brisket but I really enjoyed this brisket. I would recommend this to anybody that enjoys BBQ!

Oh, my God, does eating at Red Rooster make you feel so relevant though you don't know if you really like the food or you just love the Marcus Samuelsson memoir? Briskettown could easily have been some such concept - and this review could easily have gone in a different direction when Dan Delaney began to explain why there was no sauce on the premises. I won't go into the actual explanation here, because I'm not really sold on it (something to do with a particular style of BBQ). I am more convinced that it's an angle in a similar vein to the Soup Nazi, which seems to be a trend for restaurants in NY. All to say that it could have been a very contrived thing if not for the delivery of the explanation in the form of a very earnest owner who was not at all braggy and instead, at least, seemed to care about feedback. Anyway, so no sauce for your ribs but you can BYOS, so you win some and you lose some. This would be a worse situation if this were actually a full service restaurant, in which case, I think I would have been more peeved about the sauce. But as is, I guess it fits in with the whole DIY vibe, because who doesn't stroll around Bedford Ave with a bottle of just-in-case BBQ sauce? So, it's not a full service restaurant, which has its advantages - less expensive (not suggesting that this place is cheap), less wait time for the check at the end, and, let's be honest, considering the hipsters working at some of the restaurants in Williamsburg, best do it yourself if you want to get it done. We walked into Briskettown at the exact moment that brisket was crossed out from the evening's menu - what cruel twist of irony?! I didn't realize how hyped this place was though. We ordered 1.5 lb of short ribs and 1.25 lb of pork ribs (about 3/4 of a full rack), some greens and some beans. Since the bread was self-serve, Michael served himself 9 slices. I like short ribs about as much as I like to wear a ratty t-shirt in public, which is to say, I don't. People are always going on about textures of oysters or roe and I'm like, ARE YOU KIDDING? What about short ribs? It's like chewing on an old mop. So, I'm not a fair judge on this - except to say that the parts on the bone were significantly dryer than the meatier part. My friend was a fan though, so I guess, if this is your thing, here is a good version. The ribs were dry rubbed, not saucy, but they were cooked very well - as in they were tenderoni, but not falling off the bone. Just a touch too salty, though. In any case, I'm curious about the breakfast taco, and look forward to coming here one morning after a long run to undo the effects of the workout."
358673,2013-05-25,920,38384,0,4,"I find it easy to carry a bit of skepticism when visiting some places for the first time.  Particularly so, when they are in hip neighborhoods full of people who want to discover the next thing in dining out. First thing I`ll point out is that this location is not very close to the Bedford St. subway stop, its a whole lot closer to the Williamsburg Bridge.  So if you`re in lower Manhattan, you might as well hoof it over the bridge to get here, burn some calories before you fill them right back up. Their entrance is low-key, which I look.  No flashy or off-putting signage.  Upon entering, there is the register to your left, where you place your order.  If you are staying, you can choose one of the booths, not too many, so arrive early. But the most important thing, the food, was very good.  The namesake brisket was nice and tender.  It had a great flavor to it and did great w/o any sauce.  The veggies added a good accompaniment to the meat.  Staff was very friendly in addition."
358674,2013-05-25,920,12879,0,4,"A friend of ours recommended this brisket spot after hearing I was looking for a decent brisket spot. It is a small spot and we even missed it driving by looking for it. The restaurant decor gives off that quintessential southern comfort feel. The Food: We went here for dinner. Now, this place is known for its namesake: brisket. However, I was not a fan. It was a bit dry but the burnt ends was the best! What I thoroughly enjoyed was the short ribs! It was fall-off-the-bone, finger-licking deliciousness! Not to mention the collard greens and the beans! I am not a fan of beans but Delaney Barbecue: BrisketTown has turned me! Now that you got your essential meats and sides, you can head to the bread counter, and get as many servings as you want! As a fan of bread, this is amazing to me! I'm giving Delaney Barbecue: BrisketTown a 4 stars because I was not awed by the brisket. But that will not stop me from coming back one of these days! Bring your hungry stomachs, get your fingers dirty and, yes you can bring your own six-pack or even that bottle of your favorite spirit (a party brought their own bottle of scotch when we went) and have a great night with your friends!!!"
358675,2013-05-23,920,62433,0,4,"It is incredible how Williamsburg has become the capital of brisket in the Metro New York area.  I had great hope for this place.  The lunch option -- brisket tacos and brisket sandwiches really make up for what Fette Sau is missing. The nice thing is that you get to choose from a leaner brisket or a fattier brisket.  But their lean option is about the same as the generic brisket @ Fette Sau. That said, this place has the most expensive brisket of all three Williamsburg bbq joints though -- consider that a donation to the R&D Department of the Brisket Lab.  I am not really crazy about the hip graphic design and the retro feel.  Because when I want to eat brisket, I want to eat like a Southerner."
358676,2013-05-15,920,51685,0,5,"The brisket is killer. The short ribs really make you think about how big a cow is. They have a sandwich station at night with bread, b&b pickles and onions. The staff is so nice and helpful. Especially the guy who takes your meat order, but everyone I've interacted with is great. I love to eat here."
358677,2013-05-13,920,137330,0,4,"I am from Central Texas and pride myself on my love for BBQ, so when I heard that Delaney's was opening I was a bit skeptical.   After a few months I made it over the the BBQ spot and was thoroughly impressed! (This may be because the BBQ style that Delaney uses is from South Central Texas, I am a bit partial.) The meat was tender and incredibly tasty, it made me feel as if I was home again.   The sides were good, but I wasn't over the top impressed them.   The thing that really blew me away was the fact they carry Topo Chico!  If you don't visit Delaney for the BBQ- go simply to grab a bottle of Topo Chico, most definitely the best mineral water you will ever find.  I was a little taken back when I saw they were asking a steep $3.00 per bottle (in Texas they run about $0.50- $1.00 per bottle), however, they are an import item and as far as I know, the only place that carries this item! Love this place!"
358678,2013-05-11,920,48524,0,2,"I had a spectacular Deckle sandwich at the Smokeline location a few weekends ago. So a few friends and I headed out to the highline to get more today, but it wasn't opened due to sporadic rainy weather. We headed over to the Williamsburg location instead, expecting the same great sandwich. We were WRONG. The Smokeline Deckle was perfectly fatty, flavorful and did not need a sauce. The Briskettown Deckle was leaner, dry, and had barely enough sauce to help compensate.. It was a huge disappointment and I would never go there again for lunch. Major letdown."
358679,2013-05-03,920,2236,0,4,Breakfast tacos are the best here
358680,2013-04-26,920,47188,0,5,It was great. Enjoyed everything about it.
358681,2013-04-24,920,2962,0,2,"BYOB brisket spot, but the brisket is more expensive ($25/lb) and not as good as Fette Sau's. The line is still long, though."
358682,2013-04-21,920,15339,0,4,"I criticized others for waiting over 1.5 hours for a seat in Willysburg. There's so many other restaurants around!!  However, I found myself waiting almost 2 hours at Delaney the other day.  When you crave, you'd do ANYTHING to satisfy the craving. By the time we were able to get a seat, they only had brisket left. And it wasn't even lean!!!! It was SOOOOO good though. Well worth the wait.   Next time, I'm going earlier! Must try the ribs. Establishment: Restaurants are beginning to have a different type of vibes these days. Delaney is BYOB. & You Order yourself. The only thing the hostess does is tell you your seat is ready and throws out your garbage after you leave."
358683,2013-04-15,920,120554,0,5,"Beware!!!  Once you try Delaney's brisket, you will keep going back for more, and more, and more!!!.  I'm convinced they mix some crack into their dry rub!  All kidding aside, Delaney's is as good as it gets here in NYC.  Their brisket is so tender that it melts in your mouth and the salt and pepper charred coating is like candy.  They usually have 2 other barbecued meats on the menu.  Last time I went it was pork ribs and beef short ribs.  We opted for the pork ribs.  They were very tasty with a similar dry rub coating to the brisket and amazingly falling-off-the -bone tender.   The Collard Greens side was also quite good."
358684,2013-04-15,920,7431,0,4,Solid bbq'd brisket and pork ribs. The meat is very tender and the seasoning is done perfectly. It really brings out the juicy flavors of the meat well.
358685,2013-04-15,920,3504,0,5,"Dear lord, The Ribwich. I've been getting down with Dan Delaney's brisket since the Brisketlabs of last summer, and it's damn good. But right now, all I want is to come in here every day, give them $6, and have them give me a Ribwich. Holy SHIT, is this a good sandwich. They have taken an excellent, perfectly toasted bun (light, but substantial enough to stand up to the juicy meat), and loaded it up: The smoky, pulled rib meat (which I'm sure is excellent on its own) has been tossed in a tangy tomato sauce with just a hint of spice...and just so we're perfectly clear, this sauce has not been dumped on top as an afterthought. I'd bet that the meat has been stewed in just enough that it's incorporated the right amount of moisture, and infused with FLAVOR. Finished off with crispy slaw and a few sliced pickles on the side (I found them even better on top of the sandwich), I literally have no thoughts on how to improve this thing. Take an afternoon and come here, into their spare, American digs with Martin's Potato Bread and Crystal hot sauce (two of my favorite things) lining the shelves. Relax to the oldies piped in over the PA, enjoy the fact that there isn't the line they have at dinnertime, and order a motherfucking Ribwich. You won't regret it. And even if for some unfathomable reason you do, it was $6. Relax."
358686,2013-04-14,920,5250,0,4,"I've been meaning to finally visit this place for weeks...brisket and breakfast tacos, what else do you need in life??  I finally dragged myself here on a day off for lunch and was happy that I did.  Got the brisket sandwich, which was pretty solid...not the best you'll find even in NY but at their prices, can't complain.  The breakfast tacos may be the best you find in NY (more of a statement about what you'll find in NY vs how good they are).  Also, definitely get the potato salad, surprisingly good. Only complaint is the service, only one guy working the front during lunch and he seemed a little lost trying to deliver orders.  Brought my food to someone else's table, luckily they said it wasn't theirs and then it was promptly delivered to me.  Of course this was probably after they picked up the top of the sandwich bun to inspect its contents.  I wasn't the only mistake in delivery that afternoon either..."
358687,2013-04-08,920,14532,0,5,awesome !
358688,2013-04-05,920,1828,0,3,"I hyped myself up again and was a little let down. The brisket seemed kinda dry but the crust had amazing flavor. Gota give it up for the rub. The ribs were juicier than the brisket so that was a plus. I'm not a fat person as in I don't like chunks of fat on things I put in my mouth so if you're like me, tell them you want your piece with less fat. Trust me, I mistakenly asked for the piece with fat and it was legit 40% fat. The space is small and you do end up rubbing elbows at times. There was a line out the door the last time we went so I'm not sure how it is now. Go early to skip the lines. I left with the sweet potato pie on my mind...it was that good. Def try it even if you order 5 lbs of beef. CC accepted!"
358689,2013-04-05,920,161003,0,5,"BACK AGAIN for the first time since opening night. The dude who sliced up my meat promised they'd gotten better at cooking brisket since the last time I was there. ""Impossible"" I said. Passing through NY for a business trip from Philly, I didn't have time but had to stop in anyway. These guys just nail it! And I hear they're openig another location on the highline. Perfect for the concept. Dan Delaney is on the rise. Mad appreciation."
358690,2013-04-04,920,3768,0,1,"This place is a self-righteous dump being ran by a privileged kid who couldn't act so is 'acting'' as if he 'drove back from Texas with a smoker' knowing how to cook amazing bbq. I'd tell you if he learned to cook anything, but the people that run this place are the most surly over-zealous jerks I have ever encountered in my life."
358691,2013-04-04,920,8462,0,5,"Best brisket ever. Great sandwiches, unfortunately you can only order brisket by itself during dinner time, so we settled with a sandwich and it was great!"
358692,2013-03-30,920,98768,0,4,"we couldn't help ourselves but to compare our experience at BrisketTown with our experience at Fette Sau. the meats at BrisketTown are DEFINITELY more tender and juicier than Fette Sau. the sides are not as exciting as the ones at Fette Sau. i am a sauce person, so i wish they/BrisketTown had options for the customers beyond hot sauce.  but we found a solution - next time, we are going to order takeout :D"
358693,2013-03-28,920,1876,0,3,"Decor: 3/5 -Seats about 30 -Has a separate bar but don't expect prompt service -self serve water at the end of the bar -a tad bit too dark Service: 4/5 -only two workers, meat butter and cashier. both friendly though Food: 3/5 -The lean cut brisket is actually quite dry while the fatty cut brisket was too fatty and actually made me feel sick. -No sauce? come on! it's not THAT good without sauce. -Combine a bit of both brisket cuts on two slices of potato bread with their pickles and you've got a decent tasting sandwich!"
358694,2013-03-27,920,38149,0,5,"I feel like I have to preface every 'cue review with a disclaimer. So here's mine: I've never set foot in Texas, KC, Memphis....really anywhere that knows what they're talking about. So all I can go on is my northerner's painfully limited perspective. But I will say this, BrisketTown 100% lives up to the hype it's gotten. It makes Fette Sau look like something brought to a college potluck dinner. Get the brisket, the massive beef ribs (truly gigantic, don't even think of getting two even for a party of four), pork ribs, all of the sides...I guess you can't go wrong no matter what you do so just go crazy. I say with a straight face I would rather have this than a $90 porterhouse. It's BYOB for now so by all means acquire a case of Shiner Bock and make believe you're not on Bedford Ave. I like the vibe, the bone door handle, the friendly staff, free pickles and white bread to cut the meat-tensity. You just had a feeling there was no way this place was going to be crap, but it's so nice to know there are still places that are this dedicated to substance over style, product over marketing, dedication over making a quick splash....namely, something over nothing.  Bravo Mr. Delaney, you are the man."
358695,2013-03-24,920,128592,0,5,"Brisket is amazing, fatty or lean. Pork ribs are great, fall right off the bone. Beef rib was insane. Board beans and collared greens are top notch. Loved the apple custard pie and the key lime pie. Even the white bread is good."
358696,2013-03-22,920,161004,0,5,"Stopped in for the Breakfast Brisket Taco. It was great. Loved the slice of Lime, preventing Scurvy is important. Friendly service from the owner. Delicious coffee . Also bought a Brisket sandwich to go, outstanding. A trip well worth it for Brisket fans. Watch out,  nondescript storefront  - 359 Bedford Avenue."
358697,2013-03-18,920,161005,0,5,"Overhyped?  Nah.  It's far and away the best brisket I've had.  And despite what the others are saying, I found the owner to be quite nice.  Really."
358698,2013-03-16,920,64193,0,5,I'm a brisket guy. Trust me. Best brisket in town. Amazing German potato salad. Good potato bread and hot sauces. Very friendly service. Love it. Don't expect table service of extreme sorts since this is just not that kind of a place. This is like going to the rodeo and getting a thick few pieces of brisket. They always throw extra brisket my way also. Can't wait to go back.
358699,2013-03-16,920,77668,0,4,"Apparently Delaney has been receiving a lot of positive press lately. Shrug. I'd been walking by the storefront for months now and has just been meaning to check it out. We walked in and were greeted by a few people already waiting for tables, as well as a friendly staff member who asked us to ""sign in"" at the door. After putting our names on the list, we headed to the corner to pick up beers, after learning the place was BYOB. Delicious BBQ deserves delicious beer. We had: 1 lb brisket, 1/2 lb pork ribs, collared greens. I think the brisket, while delicious, was my least favorite part of the meal. The pork ribs with ridiculously tender and unctuous. All the delicious, greasy, smokey, meaty flavors you love in your mouth  despite KNOWING they are in no way good for you? All there. Fall-off-the-bone tender and phenomenal. Collard greens were leafy, slightly vinegary, piping hot, and not mushy at all. The brisket was spiced nicely and delicious as well. I want to go back right when they open, to try it when it's fresh -- it wasn't hot at all, and definitely felt like it had been sitting in a warming container for an hour or two. So it goes. All in all, we met Delaney -- who was super friendly and a gracious host -- and had delicious BBQ; I don't know what else I could want from an off-the-cuff Sunday dinner. I won't be waiting in line for an hour at Fette Sau the next time I want BBQ, let's just say that.  I wouldn't mind some BBQ sauce, though. Jus' sayin. See ya for breakfast tacos soon! Edit: went for breakfast. It wasn't busy at all, and the laid-back, quiet feel was really nice. Had 2 breakfast tacos and a pork rib ""ribwich"" since I thought the pork ribs were unreal the first time. Tacos were good, but nothing special. I think the meat really is better suited as BBQ and not in a taco -- I'd rather have Whirleybird, sorry! Ribwich was unreal. Tons of ribs, fresh slaw, toasty bun. Amazing. Fresh coffee and juice. Definitely worth a try, but I'd recommend the ""lunch"" items or dinner service. Leave the breakfast tacos to the pros."
358700,2013-03-13,920,161006,0,1,"If I could give them ""zero"" stars, I would.  No stars.  Surly service."
358701,2013-03-11,920,45837,0,2,"This is a true 2 star ""meh. i've experienced better."" review. I feel like the hype-machine is in overdrive for this place--I've seen no fewer than three articles on this place in the last month. The food is OK.  I've had better brisket.  I ordered a mix of fatty and lean.  The fatty was moist but didn't have much depth of flavor.  The lean was just dry.  It looked really good but the taste just wasn't there.  I was pretty surprised by that. If you expect sauce there isn't any here, except for third party hot sauces.  I completely understand the stance of not wanting the flavor of meat being covered by sauces.  But in this case the flavor isn't is amazing on its own as the owners think, and I think that if they made their own in-house sauce to compliment the meat they could still control the experience and enhance it.  Also, if you're a no-sauce place, why offer hot sauce?  It ruins the flavor just as much as bad BBQ sauce.  Seems like a contradictory stance. The collared greens were really good. The cole slaw was bland, lacked any flavor.  Really, pretty surprisingly bad. The beans were interesting, but again, pretty bland. The pecan pie was great. I ordered a pound of brisket and the above mentioned extras.  The price was a little more than $40.  So, not overpriced or anything, but not a bargain.  I ate with my partner and that was pretty much exactly the right amount of food for us. The rest of the experience is pretty bad.  There is a line outside to wait in the line inside.  Then the line inside is insanely slow because there is no visible list of what is available to order so people have to decide once they are at the front of the line, and there is only one person there to cut your meat. Despite all of the complex name lists and lines, half the tables are empty because the lines move so slowly, so obviously they haven't worked out the kinks in how to keep things moving smoothly yet.  It really aggravated me that I was made to wait outside before waiting in line when it obviously made no difference since half the tables were empty by the time I got my food.   I should also mention that arriving BEFORE they open is encouraged, which is also kind of a pain when they open at 6:30.  Also, I guess you can pre-order and get VIP treatment at 6:00, but being asked if you pre-ordered as soon as you walk up is sort of a turn off to the 95% of people who didn't.  I don't like it at Gamestop and I don't like it with BBQ either. Given that the food doesn't match the level of other Brooklyn places like Fette Sau I don't think it's worth all of the trouble of the overall experience."
358702,2013-03-03,920,8553,0,5,"The owner was adamant - he doesn't ""do"" sauce. No matter how much my friend argued, he was adamant that Brisketown would not be a place where people slop sweet brown ketchup on top of his masterpieces. That's not the way it was done back home, and that's the not way things work here. This restaurant, born out of a pop-up meat delivery surface, and now a 40-seat shop in Southern Williamsburg, has a strong point of view. This isn't Texan BBQ, this is Central Texan BBQ. Whereas the closest competitor of Brisketown - Mabel's in North Williamsburg - combines authentic North Oklahoma fare with a bit of a wink, Brisketown is a serious place. There are no concessions to what a barbecue restaurant ""should"" be or what a restaurant ""should"" have in order to be a complete meal experience. Cornbread? No. Chili? No. There are no grits or hopping john, no Frito Pie or pulled pork. On my first visit there was a hearty white bean dish, but with the Superbowl over the three sides have been down to a collared vegetable, German potato salad (with mayonnaise and mustard) and a beet salad. There's a fixins bar that includes unlimited white bread (still in loaves), Oh yes - and the brisket. It's the best in the City. The meat is fall-off-the-fork tender, with a pepper rub on the outside that pulls out the smoke. A carver offers a choice of cuts and a mixture of fatty and lean helps enrich the meal with contrasting textures. A half-pound of brisket, pork rib or two along with a bodega beer (it's BYO) and a couple slices of bread runs $20. Despite the eccentricities, it's a must-eat."
358703,2013-02-23,920,5514,0,5,"I went to an event called the ""Brisket Showdown"" and was able to compare brisket offerings from over 15 different NYC restaurants... and BrisketTown won, hands downs! The inside was very tender and juicy, while the outside was cooked to a flavorful crisp.  I could have just stood in front of their table for the entire 3 hours, happily eating away.  Too bad there were all these other ticket holders in line behind me."
358704,2013-02-19,920,13538,0,5,"Easily the best brisket I've ever had. I was surprisingly shocked at how good the collard greens (made with no ham and just butter) were. The main man came over in his fake mustache to ask how everything was and then explained they ""confit-ted the hell out of some garlc"" to make them that good. The small ribs were also the best I've eaten. Honestly I can't tell you if they were the beef or pork (I'm guessing pork) that I ended up getting, but I do know that I dislike pork ribs generally, so if he managed to make me a convert that is a huge accomplishment. I got there about 6:15 for my pre-order and we were the first ones in the restaurant, no wait, no fuss, just friendly service and delicious food. By 6:35 there was a decent line and four to five tables full. Get there early! Side note: Two friends bailed on me last minute so my pre-ordered 2.5lbs meat ended up being way too much for me and my vegan girlfriend to eat. I doggie-bagged and fed my parents and sister. They all unanimously declared it was bar-none the best they've had too. That speaks volumes as we come from a strong brisket family (although typically roasted in the oven, not smoked). I'm kicking myself for not trying the other sides, but I guess I'll just have to go back for my remaining pounds."
358705,2013-02-19,920,161007,0,5,"The brisket was pretty amazing especially the fatty.   My only complaint is how the ""system"" works to get your food and a table.  There was an enormous group that must have been part of the pre order and since it's BYOB they sure took advantage of that.  I think if they ever get a liquor license this will be solved because you'll be able to drink while you wait but with out that I felt like I was waiting in line to wait in line."
358706,2013-02-18,920,18831,0,5,"Both the brisket and the pork ribs are fantastic.  Definitely the best I've had in NYC.  While the style is different from Kansas City (KC cooks with a rub and leaves a bottle of sauce on the table; in TX, sauce is verboten for BBQ), it compares very favorably with the best places there. I feel like an asshole just for saying this at a bbq place, but the collard greens may have been the best thing on the menu...and I'm not even a big fan. Get there before 6:30, the line will be long, especially if the weather is good (and even if it's not). Currently, BYOB and there's a bodega with a pretty good beer selection a block north on Bedford. Prices are towards the upper end of the $$ range."
358707,2013-02-13,920,8275,0,5,"Nothing short of phenomenal . I tried both brisket and ribs, and these were by far the best Ive had in a loooong time. Some things shouldnt be too complicated and this is no exception. Dry rub, slow cooked for 16 hrs, and sooooo good that you forget all manners and finger licking comes out in droves.  This is not the place for the faint of heart, if you love great BBQ, especially melt in your mouth brisket, this is the place."
358708,2013-02-01,920,78642,0,5,"Amazing.   My friends and I came on a Friday night after work.  Very smart getting there right at 6:30 when the doors open for dinner, no line, but it started about 30 minutes later.  The owner/chef was very polite and discussed his technique with one of dinner goers who is into BBQ.  We ordered the brisket, ribs, slaw, potato salad, collard greens and pecan pie.  Side of bread and pickles.  The meat was so flavorful and tender...so soft it fell apart.  All the sides had great distinct flavors.  Pecan pie delish, had a maple syrup flavor.  The manager was super friendly, came to help clear our table and even had good humor about me grabbing my bag as he approached us from behind. I would totally recommend to anyone who loves BBQ. If you need a comparison to other BBQ in BK, Far better than Fletchers, not even a contest."
358709,2013-01-31,920,161008,0,5,"simply amazing. Dinner and the new breakfast tacos are all outstanding. Not only is the meat the best I've ever had, even the sides are delectable. I highly recommend Brisket Town for anyone who loves awesome food!"

358711,2013-01-24,920,133139,0,3,"First, the brisket was absolutely delicious! I'm tempted to given them 5 stars purely on that basis. However, everything else was just ok to meh. Part of the problem is that there were only two options for sides, and we weren't particularly interested in either. Personally, I like a some variety in what I'm eating over the course of a meal, so if it's just a big pile of meat, as awesome as that pile is, I'm going to be a bit disappointed. We did have the potato salad, but didn't finish it. The cheese was fine, but didn't really go with the meal. The pumpkin pie had a bit of an odd texture to it, almost like flan. The ambience is fine. The butcher paper and plastic ware weren't my favorite, but they didn't particularly bother me, and they were playing fun music. If I lived near there, I would probably order the meat to go and pair it with my own sides all the time, which we did with the leftovers to excellent effect. I'll probably give it another shot some time, but for scratching the bbq itch, I'm more likely to stick with places that are a little more convenient and better overall, even if the meat isn't quite as good."
358712,2013-01-23,920,52880,0,5,Wow.  That's how I felt every time I took a bite of brisket.  I can't wait to cash in on my pre-bought lb.  I will go again and share this experience with my loved ones.
358713,2013-01-22,920,154414,0,4,"A mix of standards here. Food is amazing, especially the moist brisket. Pork rib was the best I've ever had, much better than Hill Country, which is a good comparison joint to the Texas style BBQ they are going for here. You can pass on the lean brisket, unless you just want to try it, as I did. Too dry, and too much straight fatty when not. Tip - ask for burnt ends, and they will give you the best part (crust/meat/fatty combo) of the fatty brisket. Double standard was the atmosphere and service. Both are good, don't get me wrong, just not my preferred style. The place is lit by candles only. You'll think you're back on the set of Barry Lyndon with how dark it is in there. Problem is, this place doesn't have Kurbrick's cinematographer. And service wise, they are a tad too slow. And this isn't my nyc mind coming through - I've been to the central Texas joints, and it just isn't very streamlined here at Delaney's. Again, not the end of the world, as that's something that can easily be remedied. Overall, absolutely worth the trip."
358714,2013-01-22,920,17924,0,4,"So, we ordered a pound of brisket ahead of time and it was pretty freaking tasty. Even better though (!) were the ribs. They were so amazing and they literally fell off the bone. The cole slaw was only average sadly (just a touch too sweet, but that's likely a palette thing). The wait was a little extreme, we got there at 6 and waited until 6:45 with only about 6 parties ahead of us. Would do again but only if we could pre-order.... PS. Delaney himself came by and asked how we enjoyed the food."
358715,2013-01-18,920,161010,0,5,"pricey, but the real thing. Think how much it would cost to travel to texas."
358716,2013-01-17,920,112381,0,5,"The only reason this restaurant is not worthy of 5 stars is because you are from out of town and have a much better knowledge of superior brisket joints. I am not you and Delaney's gets 5 stars cause it rocks my socks. For NYC brisket, it really does not get much better (fette sau dont kill me, I have been and continue to be a loyal/regular customer). It is also very simple. Not 100 menu items - I like straight forward. ""Brisket: more or less fat?"" ""Oh you want kick ass potato sald and red slaw? Here have a heaping serving of both."" ""Now go get a beer at the always uncrowded bar and smother you food in pickles and onions."" - Well done guys."
358717,2013-01-12,920,56619,0,5,"They have breakfast tacos, by far some of the best savory breakfast/brunch I've had in a while. The brisket and ribs during dinner service are topnotch. Seating doesn't seem to be a problem in the morning. People have been talking about seating like it defines the entire experience. In fact I enjoy that people have to be patient to get seated here. The food is off the hook, that's what matters. So far I haven't been let down"
358718,2013-01-06,920,74676,0,4,"I had reserved a pound of brisket what seemed like an eternity ago, but Saturday I finally got out to Delaney BBQ. We arrived (barely found the place because they don't even have a sign outside!) around 615 PM.  There was already a line 8 people deep. The line moved a bit slowly but we eventually arrived a the counter to claim our prize. We chose 1/2 lean and 1/2 fatty brisket and 4 ST Louis ribs. The lean brisket had a nice taste but was a bit on the dry side, whereas the fatty side was much nicer, and flavorful. There was a thick bark on the edges and the rub wasn't overpowering and it had a hint of black pepper. The ST Louis ribs were quite good and also had a good smoke ring. For sides we chose red cabbage coleslaw and German potato salad. Each of the sides were very good. They even have Mexican coke!  I wanted to order a second one and one of the staff said he would get one. When he returned he was apologetic about the waits so he comped us!  That was unexpected. Be forwarded the seating is quite cramped and on the dark side.   It is worth the wait...oh and they're slogan is perfect. ""Fat is the new black!"""
358719,2013-01-05,920,161011,0,5,"Updating to include the breakfast tacos and the pastries that will be a part of the daytime operation. The breakfast tacos are amazing, with the potential to be even better.  Right now, there are three kinds of tacos: brisket (it is BrisketTown, after all), pork (with pulled pork and bacon), and veggie (featuring Brussels sprouts.  All three were really great, with the veggie taco being the surprising winner. Also had the rice krispie treat w/ walnuts and the pecan pie.  Both pastries are really good if you're not up for a savory start to your day. Oh yeah, the coffee (supplied by Blue Bottle Coffee) is as good as it gets in the city. Great thing about all this:  it wasn't all that heavy, as opposed to their dinners.  Great way to start the day!"

358723,2012-12-22,920,25732,0,5,"i went to school in pittsburgh, and my favorite things about that city were the hearty comfort food and incredibly down to earth and friendly people. some of the best restaurants in that city are up in the hills (literally), behind nondescript doors, with dark hallways that lead to humble insides. the people greet you with a friendly (but gruff) nod, hand a homely menu filled with meat, fries, and more potatoes, and plenty of western pa beer options. well, sans the beer (and menu), and with that williamsburg pizzaz, this place was a walk down memory lane for me back into one of my favorite haunts in that old steel city. from the outside, this place isn't really much to look at, just like the part of bedford where it is located. the interior is dark, but warm and cozy. the only flash in the whole place is just as much decorative as informative--a giant cow with the word briskettown above, letting you know you've made it to the right place. you step up to the meat counter, and you are greeted by some of the friendliest people you could ever meet working at a restaurant. the whole experience is a mix between meat counter and restaurant, which makes it both perplexing for the virgin visitor and exciting at the same time. after a juicy sample and five minutes chatting away at the counter, we walked to our table with a pound of the most succulent brisket i've ever savored. also on the plate (or should i say sheet of paper) came two slices of homemade white bread, a generous scoop of pickles, and handful of sliced onions. a pile of paper towel rolls, selection of hot sauces, and plastic forks sits at one counter, while a water dispenser with plastic cups sits in the back. everything about this set up feels charming, function over form, but authentic to the experience. it helped that we were walking in at christmas time and were able to enjoy some old time christmas carols being played over the speaker system. the perfect soundtrack to compliment the experience. the food was amazing, but the people really made the visit worthwhile. we were visited many times throughout our dinner for friendly conversation. they were incredibly helpful and passionate about what they were serving. you know the food is good when people take as much pride in it as this group did, and i'm grateful to them for all of it. i'll be back again soon. next time for the ribs."
358724,2012-12-20,920,94267,0,5,"I've been to some of the best BBQ places in the country. I've had BBQ from the Carolina's, KC, and have been to a bunch of places in the Texas BBQ belt. Having eaten in these areas, I'll bluntly state this; Delaney deserves a place up there with some of the great ones. The brisket here is that good! The pieces I had passed what I like to call the butter test for brisket. I usually think that fat on a piece of meat is pretty disgusting, except for a properly smoked piece of brisket  if its done right, the fat is like butter... It's practically spreadable on the meat and adds a tremendous amount of moisture and flavor. Almost every piece of brisket found in the northeast fails this test. Most people around here relate brisket to this tough, shoe leathery piece of meat that is often masked by a super rich bbq sauce. To those people, be prepared to have your definition of brisket turned upside down. Watching Dan pull a full piece of brisket out of the warming box, I knew I was in for a treat. The scent of smoke hit my nose hit me just as I see him unraveling the brisket from the butcher paper he smoked it in. No one, outside the legit places in central Texas & in my backyard wrap their briskets in butcher paper. Most will wrap it in foil, which helps tenderize the meat, but at the expense of a nice crisp bark. The butcher paper manages to speed up cooking time and retain moisture without compromising the wonderful crunchy bark. Anyway, when he got it unwrapped, it hit the cutting board like a piece of jello... When it was cut into, it looked the part. The smoke ring and juices were visible and it cut like butter. Outside of Franklin BBQ in Austin, I've probably never been so excited to eat a piece of brisket. Within a second of taking my first bite, the brisket did not disappoint. The salt and pepper rub perfectly complimented the smoky flavor, which made the tender meat taste the part. The flavor was further accented by the fresh pickled which imparted a slight sweetness to the meat. All together, it was - by far- the best brisket I've had at a restaurant outside of Texas. I really have to question the motives and/or the taste buds of the few reviewers who ripped the brisket here. I really can't give it enough superlatives to do it any justice. The owner Dan, was also a stand up guy. After hearing my interest in BBQ, he sat with me and talked BBQ for about tens mins. Go eat at delaney soon, because once the words gets out more, the lines will get stupid."
358725,2012-12-18,920,21063,0,5,"This place is a real treat, Brand new but already a gem for sure. Plain and simple are the key secret ingredients with fresh slaw & German potato salad alongside your choice of pork ribs or beef brisket. Served with a side a white bread, pickles, and onions, this will probably be in of the top 5 best ribs & brisket you've ever had, hands down. Daniel Delaney has spent time crafting his process for slow smoking that meat, and at this point, it's safe to say he's mastered it. Being from the South, I'm hesitant on chowing on ""Northern"" attempts... I've had some of the worst food period eating in bar b que joints up here... But, I can't emphasize more that this place can hang with the best. Why are you waiting to go? Meat falling off the bones... Just say that in your head... Then imagine the perfect rub. Then imagine getting your choice of fatty or lean brisket...  Cut that with a spoon... ALL served to you by the grillmaster himself! Hope you enjoy it - Definitely better brisket than Fette Sau... No sauce needed here! Oh and for now, it's BYOB!"
358726,2012-12-17,920,161012,0,5,"My wife and I are obsessed with barbeque since the Smoked Joint in Philly closed many years ago. This place is the best that we've found since then. Cooked completely by smoking using oak brought up from Texas. We got the ribs and both varieties of brisket, regular and lean. The meat is tender and delicious with just the right amount of peppery bark.  Same for the ribs which were fall-off-the-bone tender.  Comes with pickles and onions with various sides nightly. As my wife is not too keen on German potato salad we got only the red cabbage slaw, which was great.  This was a fabulous meal and there were ample leftovers, enough to take back home and treat ourselves and friends the next day. A word about desert...we got a slice of the apple custard pie.  One pet peeve is soggy crust...NOT TO WORRY...this pie was baked fresh that day and the crust crunchy and the filling perfectly cooked.  It is a short crust made right there. This is a BYOB place and there is your choice of beer or wine within a short walk.  Easy to get to as right under the Williamsburg Bridge. All in all a fabulous meal.  We will be sure to return there next time we're visiting the city."
358727,2012-12-16,920,161013,0,5,"Had a great time here the other week. Its crowded with limited seating, but I thought it was a fun experience even when we were in line. Its BYOB, so pick up a six pack on your way over. Ribs are just as tasty as the brisket (both fantastic with a peppery dry rub). I think it rivals most of the BBQ I have had in TX. Sides are ok, but it is all about the meat."
358728,2012-12-13,920,133902,0,5,"Holy fucking shit. Eating here is like having some kind of unimaginably delicious meat form of tequila. You'll be giddy and want to hug strangers from joy, maybe lick brisket grease off their bodies. Whoever described it as ""meat candy"" got it spot on."
358729,2012-12-13,920,71062,0,3,"It cannot be disputed that Dan Delaney and Briskettown offer some of the most tender, buttery, delicious smoked BBQ brisket in NYC. His experiment worked, getting people to buy in early, using pre-paid customers as guinea pigs to perfect his recipe and technique.  The addition of ribs, though not necessary, was welcome, as they achieved high marks in my book for both tenderness and flavor. The sides and pies were all worth the few bucks extra they cost, particularly the apple custard pie, which sold out by 7:30. If a dining experience is solely about the food, Briskettown would receive 5 stars. But, as a dining experience, I think Delaney still has some tweaking to do. The premise is this: if you pre-ordered meat, you're welcome to show up at 6:00 and eat early. At 6:30, doors open to the public. Regardless, when you arrive, you go up to the counter, order your food, seat yourself, and chow down.  Length of wait varies based on how many people are ahead of you; I went on a Wednesday night, and while the line did get to the door, it never appeared to extend outside. I have no issue with this dining concept, and it is pretty clearly stated on Delaney's website.   What isn't detailed is that the space is quite small (about 32 seats in a space no more than 14 feet wide), that your party should all arrive together, and that large groups are frowned upon.   I wasn't aware of these unwritten rules, and so my husband and I showed up shortly after 6, hoping to score a table for us and five friends that were joining us, all of us having pre-bought meat. I was up front with the host about the timing of our friends' arrival, and he asked that my husband and I wait at a small 2-top until other members of our party arrived to allow others to sit and eat. I had no problem with this, and he seemed not to either, as the restaurant was less than half full when a couple of our friends arrived 45 minutes later. We moved to a 6-top, and were shortly thereafter joined by another friend, filling out the table but one chair. We got our food, then got some more, then wrapped up some leftovers because one couple over-ordered, and then that couple left and the couple that was running late showed up seconds later, at about 8:00. And that's when things got a little weird. The host stopped by and kind of flipped out, notifying me that we had been sitting for two hours and he now had a huge line of people. He acknowledged that our other friends had just arrived, but the business model was based on people not staying too long, and asked, ""What would you have me do?"" before storming off. Wow. Awkward. And, let's be honest, bad business, too. You don't chide paying customers for staying too long. Sh*t happens. People get stuck in traffic, get pulled into late meetings, get on a train with a sick passenger.  And when your friends arrive late, you're happy to see them and want to chat, even though you've already eaten. Was it an inconvenience that my friends were late? Yes. Was it the end of the world? No. Did food go to waste? No. In fact, they sold out right around 9:00pm. Did customers walk out? Not that I noticed, and when I got up to use the bathroom about 20 minutes after my scolding, I saw 4 empty tables in the restaurant, including two that could have been pushed together to make a 4-top, the number my party was down to at that time. Front-of-house service is about decorum and problem-solving; the host was lacking in both. Had he graciously requested that we move to a smaller table so he could seat a large party, we would have gladly done so. Instead, he panicked and said, ""I mean, I can't tell you to leave,"" while implicitly expressing he'd like us to do just that. And telling a customer that your business model doesn't work if they remain present is the same as telling them that your business model doesn't work. Restaurants need customers, and when the hype dies down and the novelty of the whole thing wears off, the customers that will come back are the ones that enjoyed their entire experience, not just the 'cue. I think Briskettown has a lot of promise, but from an operational standpoint it needs some fine-tuning. List the number of seats on the website, it tells customers a lot about what to expect. Also note on the site that only full parties will be seated and seats can't be saved. Heck, make it a rule: No Meat, No Seat. Limit party size. Or just take reservations.  Accept the fact that sometimes people will stay longer than you want them to, and sometimes they won't show. Sometimes people will order less, tip less, and spend less than you want them to, and sometimes you'll be in the weeds trying to keep up. Sometimes you'll sell out at 7:45, and sometimes you'll be hoping for drunk co-eds to wander in when the bars empty out to finish your day's supply. It's the restaurant business, you need to roll with it, be ready for anything, and maintain composure. And value you your customers. All of them."

If you can guess the secret of my love for you We both could know the secret of the sea"" AND presumably know the secret of this insanely delicious meat. I have a guess... I think it's the residual narcotics outside the Pfizer property where they smoke this stuff... In addition, the owner himself served us, and was super welcoming and generous! Blindingly good.

358732,2012-12-11,920,48967,0,5,"MOST AMAZING BRISKET EVER! The place opens up at 6:30pm so I made sure to be there at 6:00 because I heard it fills up quick and runs out of food fast.  Unfortunately, the city was doing an inspection of the place so there was a mob of hungry people waiting outside so I decided to go t o the corner deli to get some beers because the place is also BYOB.  At around 7 an official A grade was placed on the door and with a short prep time they were open for business.  The place is cafeteria style so you get your food pay for it then sit down.  This line felt like forever but only because the aroma of Brisket was in the air and my tummy had been rumbling since 5pm.  After selecting my food the very friendly staff told us that since they got an A on their inspection and that we waited so long they were giving us pie on the house, butternut pie with a dollop of whipped cream, YUM!  The seating was limited and a tight fit but I managed to get some seats and began chowing down.  It was the juiciest, most tender and flavorful brisket I have ever eaten in New York and worth the price tag.  You can only find this stuff this good in the south so it's nice to find a place closer to home. The potato salad was also pretty great.  I will be coming back."
358733,2012-12-08,920,161014,0,5,"There are no words that speaks to how RI-GOD-DAMN-DICULOUSLY DELICIOUS the brisket is at BrisketTown. It can be described as ""meat candy"". I must confess, when it comes to barbecue I usually go for the ribs cause the brisket usually lets me down, But not in BrisketTown. No Sir!!! Brisket is king (ALL PRAISES DUE!!). So tender & perfectly seasoned. It melts in your mouth with every bite (this was the point where my toes curl and my eyes closed and I truly knew what it felt like when doves cry). To break up the spell of the almighty brisket I suggest you order the potato salad...What the f#@k!...Wow...Wow..(applause) The potato salad is also f**king amazing too? Such a great collaboration flavor like the first time you listened to Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) with potato salad as Old Dirty Bastard. Get there early cause they do run out. My crew just made the cutoff and it was so worth it. During the slicing of the voluptuous brisket and rib portions. there was a part of me that wanted pull out a stack of ones and make it rain. but I didn't (i regret it) This is a byob but we opted for the Mexican coke ( sidebar- does anyone else get disappointed when someone offers you Mexican coke and you get a beverage?) Anyway a pound  of brisket and a pound of ribs will feed three people easily.I must go back there cause I left a piece of my soul in an oily napkin that wreaks of brisket brilliance"
358734,2012-12-03,920,161015,0,4,"A friend and I dropped by on Friday night when 1/2 lb of brisket that I'd RSVP'ed became available.  We came by around 9:00 and the sign said that they were out of food for the evening, but when I told them I'd reserved my Brisket, Dan came out and was happy to serve us.  He brought us up to the counter, let us sample some of the delicious bark and meat, asked us if we preferred fatty, lean or a combination.  We added on 1/2 lb of ribs and a side of the coleslaw (they were out of the potato salad).  We helped ourselves to some pickles and onions and hot sauce, and grabbed a few plastic utensils.  With the reserve brisket added on it came to a extremely reasonable $30. The food itself was a bit of a mixed bag.  The eponymous brisket is, unsurprisingly, divine.  With little in the way of sauce or seasoning beyond salt and pepper, the unquestioned star of the show is the juicy, fatty beef sliced in long slivers on the tray.  The meat is delicious from any place on the cut, the fattier meat being an tongue-coating indulgence, and the bark being a smoky, salty treat.  They blend well together and with the sides of pickles, onions, and slaw, but the brisket is even better on its own.   The slaw was good, non-traditional.  It lacked a creaminess that I tend to prefer to balance the spice of most places, but seemed unnecessary without a hot barbecue sauce to sit opposite of.  It was crisp, not soggy, and had a bit of a kick of its own that was more than acceptable for a side. The ribs were frankly a disappointment.  For a place that seemingly slow-cooks the brisket into a juicy, meaty pudding (in the best sense of the word), the ribs were fairly dry, and lacked the juicy, slow-cooked texture that was imparted onto the brisket.  The flavors were good, but the cook was fairly inconsistent.  It's understandable why this is not called ""rib-town"". This is a stripped down BBQ joint at its most skeletal.  Help yourself to a roll of paper towels and hot sauce, and be prepared to share and get your fingers dirty.  You can make yourself a 'sandwich' of sorts by grabbing the brisket with your wonder bread and slopping the pickles, onions, and hot sauce on with it, but its at its best on its own.  If you want fancy table service, this is not the restaurant for you, and yet the atmosphere of the restaurant is one of the things that will keep me coming back."

This is the exception, y'all. Brisket that's so tender, it falls apart in your mouth. Ribs that just slide off the bone. Holy sh*t. This place is just as good, if not better, than some of the best places in Texas. This is how barbeque should be done, and if you've ever craved the legit stuff -- add this place to your list and come soon. Apart from the amazing meat, the sides are just as delicious from the cole slaw to the potato salad, and even the pickles! And if you see pie on the menu -- get it. I will be back! Soon, and often."

Are you serious?  We showed up at 6 PM on a Sunday, having pre-ordered 4 lbs of brisket.  After being let in, we stood on line for quite awhile, and eventually asked the manager what the chances were of being seated.  ""Slim to none"" was not what he said, but implied, in a clearly disinterested  manner.  We left.  Honestly, as long as there are people dumb enough and with enough disposable income (clearly many, as evidenced by the long line as we exited) to stand on line for a pricey piece of meat (which in no way could justify the inconvenience), ""buzzy"" dumps like this will thrive.  I'd rather go to Blimpie.   (We actually went to a lovely Argentinian restaurant  nearby, with great food, ambiance and service.)"

I'm definitely impressed with the service and now my stomach is already growling...red meat month it is!"
358738,2012-11-30,920,47693,0,3,"first things first, the brisket is delicious. the night i visited, my partner and i arrived shortly after it opened and, while there were initially no open tables, a few opened up by the time we had our meat. if you're there when it opens, chances are good you'll get a table. if not, you'll probably have a bit of a wait. at the time of our visit, they were still waiting on their liquor license, so, sadly, no alcohol. it's byob for the time being and there are plenty of options in the neighborhood if you want to pick something up beforehand. there were two meats offered: brisket ($25/lb) and pork ribs ($22/lb). with the brisket, you could opt for leaner or fattier or a combination of both. we opted for both. the ribs were very meaty and pretty tasty, but the real star of the show is the brisket. there were a couple of sides: potato salad and coleslaw ($5 each... i think). we didn't get the coleslaw, though it looked good, and went with just the potato salad. it was loaded with bacon and that's rarely a bad thing. they were also giving out test slices of pumpkin pie, presumably something they're going to offer in the future (if the testing was net positive). honestly, the pumpkin pie was nothing special, but it was nice to have something mildly sweet at the end of the meal. they also offer pickles and onions as a free accompaniment to your meat and it's definitely worth getting the pickles (didn't try the onions). the place is generally packed and expect to sit elbow to elbow with the people next to you. also don't expect to carry on a normal volume conversation. at $25/lb, i feel it's a bit overpriced, but it seems like, at least for the time being, people are willing to pay. with other bbq places in the area charging $16/lb, i can't say that the brisket was $9 better, but it was definitely good. if you're a brisket connoisseur, it's probably best to go and decide for yourself."
358739,2012-11-28,920,31513,0,3,"We pre-ordered brisket from Delaney BBQ back in August, and followed their procedure in RSVPing and showing up at 6 pm for our supposed 'priority' line. Instead, we got on one line of people with and w/o reservation. Everyone who was on line before 6 got in at 6.  It made us wonder why we even bothered with the whole reservation system. That said, the ribs were VERY good. It was tender and succulent, but pricey at around $27/lb. The brisket was average and comparable to other BBQ joints in NYC. I wanted so much to LOVE Delaney BBQ, but found that despite the friendly service and great ribs, there were a number of significant flaws, such as: not following reservation policy; long wait on the line and slow service; and price. I understand WHY it was so pricey, but given the taste of the brisket I wouldn't say it was worth what we paid for it. A lot of hype surrounded the opening of this restaurant which unfortunately increased my disappointment after actually going there. It's not bad, but not fantastic."

358741,2012-11-26,920,161016,0,5,"First things first. There's a new Sheriff in town. The Brisket is sublime. As in other-worldly. Truly, as good as anything you'll find in the legendary joints in and around Austin, and I've eaten in most of them.  And the ribs I tasted were impossibly sweet and wonderful. Pitmaster Dan Delaney analogizes BBQ to Jazz -- both are uniquely American art forms and both are under-appreciated by the masses, perhaps due to the power of their simplicity. Combining these 2 elements under the roof of Briskettown is one of the many, many things Delaney gets right. Briskettown does not reinvent BBQ. Great BBQ does not need reinvention. It just needs to be faithfully, artfully recreated, which is is, using only five (no kidding) ingredients: salt, pepper, heat, smoke and brisket. Thats it. Seriously. How then, you say, can the output be so fucking amazing? The ""secret sauce"" (there actually is no sauce, and you won't need it) lies in Dan's unrelenting respect to his craft. And patience. Dan is a perfectionist, in the best sense, and it shows throughout. This past summer's Brisket Lab, was exactly that. A painstaking process by which Delaney broke down and then reassembled all of the critical elements of great Brisket. The cooking is done ONLY with wood as fuel. I mean, the man won't even light the wood with a match, but rather uses only flaming butcher paper. Practice makes perfect and Delaney practiced. A lot. The brisket slices beautifully, yet falls apart at the slightest prodding. A knife is unnecessary. The outside is perfectly charred, with just the right balance of (yes) salt and pepper. The intense flavor comes mostly from the rendering of the fat, so DO NOT be afraid to order at least some of the meat on the fatty side. And do yourself the favor, at least once, of closing your eyes and eating a full on fatty cut of meat. There will be no gristle. Rather, it will melt in your mouth, like perfectly prepared marrow. The sides are exactly what you need. A touch of raw onion, pickle slices, a lovely sweet cole slaw, with a touch of basil, and a slice of (soon to be freshly baked) pullman white bread.  Swig it down with a fresh, cold brew. Enjoy the live music (usually from the French Quarter) and relax in a no-frills, but beautifully woody environment. Yes, there will be a line. And yes, the meat will run out fairly early, fairly often. Deal with it. Briskettown is worth every bit of the wait. I'll be going back very soon."
358742,2012-11-21,920,62762,0,3,"The ribs were juicy but somewhat lacking in flavor, while the brisket was a bit on the dry side. Not bad, but nothing great. I definitely want some of whatever the previous reviewers were smoking."
358743,2012-11-20,920,7860,0,1,"I will happily update this review once I actually get past the front door of this place. Jesus Christ. 1) One of the owners gave my friend & me a postcard for Delaney about a week before it opened. He wrote ""Nov 15th"" on it and told us to come on opening night. He also told us they'd be carrying Shiner Bock, which almost made me piss my pants with excitement, as Shiner doesn't exist anywhere in NY state at the moment. 2) On November 15th, I schlepped directly from work to Williamsburg to sink my teeth into a juicy Texan brisket slab and wash it all down with a Shiner. I was salivating. But at the door, the owner informed me that it was ""friends & family night"" and they didn't have enough food for people not on the list. He assured us we could come back later for drinks ""on him"" but we opted out, agreeing we'd return another day to get the full experience. 3) Several days later, we returned to Delaney. We had already eaten dinner, but wanted to see if they did indeed have Shiner Bock. But no. They don't have their liquor license yet, so it's BYOB. And obviously there's no Shiner at the bodega next door. We left, again disappointed. 4) Last night, we tried again. But it was closed. Wah wah. Delaney, never before have my hopes been so high for a new restaurant in New York! Texan brisket! Texan beer! This is what I've been waiting for since I moved to the city! And here I sit, weeks later, brisketless, Shinerless, and generally disappointed. I'll try again. I'll review again. But I'll do it when I damn well feel like it. And right now, that looks to be a while from now. Wah wah."
358744,2012-11-19,920,161017,0,5,"I've been a fan of Dan and his BBQ since I attended one of the early BrisketLabs last summer.  I was so excited to try the restaurant and it is absolutely amazing.  It is the best brisket I've ever tasted and I've had a lot of brisket.  It is certainly the best brisket in NYC.  The brisket is juicy (even the lean) and flavorful with an incredible peppered ""bark"".   I hear he is about to introduce ribs to BrisketTown - can't wait to try those.  I'm sure they will be amazing.  From now on, whenever I want BBQ in NYC Delaney Barbecue will be my choice."
358745,2012-11-18,920,161018,0,5,best bbq EVER!
358746,2012-11-18,920,7541,0,5,5 stars because it's mother fucking Dan Delaney. Yeahhhhhhhh Brisket.
358747,2012-11-18,920,161019,0,4,"Ate there on the official opening day. The brisket was no-non sense. Hands down the best brisket I've ever had! The atmosphere was perfect for the food and I enjoyed the live band. The place almost had a Western movie feel to it without the swinging doors, and I loved it. BrisketTown was more of an experience than just another meal. Can't wait to go back."
358748,2012-11-16,920,141858,0,5,"A warm and welcoming space with the best brisket I've tasted.  Even the cole slaw was delicious!  The band was a great addition, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.  We'll be back!"
358749,2012-09-23,920,84911,0,4,"Had my second round of this brisket.  Besides the monsoon that was happening outside, it was 100% better.  Not as salty as my first experience.  The fatty part was nice and tender as the lean portion.  Delaney Barbecue has nailed the brisket..."
358750,2012-08-16,920,3235,0,4,"Oh Dan Delaney, you magnificent SOB. For months I was waiting for you to start your brisket experiment. I waited out the first few labs and it sounded like you guys made some good changes for everyone's benefit. I went to the event at The Woods in Williamsburg. It was a great venue, and it was very well organized. There weren't any beer specials outside of the regular bar deals though (I think it was because they switched venues last minute). The brisket was delicious. Tender and juicy. The lean portions weren't too dry, and the fatty parts... oh man. So good, it just melts in your mouth (the regret of eating such fatty meat also melts once you realize how good it is). I will say that the sides they had at this event (onions, pickles and radish slaw) were a bit disappointing. They were good (and unlimited), but I expected something more substantial. All in all, a great event, and I've got one more to go to in a few weeks!"
358751,2012-07-19,920,6674,0,5,"This is a review for a Brisketlab event, which is the BBQ restaurant development series happening throughout the city in the summer of 2012. Daniel Delaney is a pretty cool guy. He fell in love with Texas brisket and decided to bring it - no frills, just the best brisket - to New York. So he bought an 18' smoker, a bunch of oak, and a LOT of meat, and brought it to the city in the spring of 2012. Signups started online in the spring, and boy am I glad I heard about it in time to sign up, since Brisketlab sold 2,500 pounds in 48 hours! The events are held all over the city, in several boroughs. I went to my first event last night, at the Boxee Studio in Chelsea. It was such a cool space! Hardwood floors, chevron carpets, big white desks, modern pouf chairs, and a big room with space for the fantastic band that played all evening. One of the first things I noticed about Brisketlab when I arrived at 7 pm was that it was utterly unfussy and unpretentious, a rarity in this city. Yes, everyone had paid $25/lb for their brisket (you can split that into two half-pounds, and go to two events), and some of the women were in high heels and sundresses, but this is Manhattan, and that's to be expected. But seriously, everyone was friendly and laid back, and you could tell we were all so curious to meet Dan and try the brisket. People milled around listening to music in the studio, chatting and standing in line for brisket. When I got to the head of the line with my boyfriend, a Texan*, we gazed, drooling, at the brisket. Huge slabs of amazing meat on a cutting board right in front of us, and there was Daniel Delaney himself (he's so nice!), asking us whether we'd like a lean cut or a more fatty piece. I chose the former; my boyfriend the latter. Then we moved down the counter and another guy served us coleslaw, onions, pickles, and that classic piece of white bread. The coleslaw in particular was fantastic - tangy and dotted with cilantro and mint. I wished we had been served more pickles, but then again, we all know how I feel about pickles. The brisket did not disappoint. My Texan* boyfriend was initially disappointed by the lack of sauce, but quickly found the meat so flavorful that sauce was unnecessary. It cut with a fork, soft and buttery, and melted in my mouth. The edges were just the tiniest bit crispy, providing a superb balance to the soft, rich slices of brisket. We washed it all down with $2 pints of Sixpoint Sweet Action and Sixpoint Crisp...delicious. All in all, it seemed like this Brisketlab went swimmingly. There was only one minor hiccup that I noticed: the ice for the beer was late in arriving, and so people had to wait 30 minutes or so to get their beer. That said, everyone seemed to be having a blast, and I have no doubt that if Daniel Delaney wants to open up Delaney BBQ in the near future, he'll already have quite the following. Can't wait for my next Brisketlab! *Not actually Texan, he'd want me to tell you; but spent enough years in Texas enjoying Texas BBQ that he knows what's up."
358752,2014-11-16,921,161020,1,2,This place manages to mess up dishes that are delicious everywhere else and charge way too much. At least the service is terrible.
358753,2012-11-25,921,161021,1,2,"I used to really enjoy the place for the relaxed vibe and good cocktails. However I've had a few recent terrible experiences with the service that have led to me give a bad review. Most recently during an attempt to get brunch, we waited 45 min o get water after repeated requests (we eventually walked to the bar to get it ourselves), 1 hour for coffee (the waitress said there was none brewed an yet we saw people who had come I after us being served) and after 1.5 hrs of waiting for an omelet and repeatedly asking where our food was, the waitress finally checked and told us that whoops, the order was never put in. No apology. When I asked if she could rush the order (my friend had a flight) she said that no, she had to have the orders made for all the tables that came in after us, rather than rushing ours to rectify her mistake. It was really disappointing and added to he recent poor and slow service i had experienced. It's too bad because the food is decent and the cocktails are great but the service just makes it a no go."
358754,2014-10-31,921,161022,1,4,"Bijan's is a beautiful surprise, if you're new in the neighborhood, as I was.  And Henry, the barkeep and uber server, makes you feel welcome and gives great advice on the menu.  This is an oasis in Brooklyn.  I kind of hate to advertise it, because I like it to myself.  But you must go.  I had a calamari dish that was delicious and a new rose that is both dry enough and tasty.  A pleasure.  And the decor is interesting, if you love art and atmosphere.  Good pour by Henry, behind the bar.  I'm going back.  The owner seems nice, too."
358755,2014-10-19,921,161023,1,4,"Hell yeah! Great intimate rustic ambiance. Delicious food. I don't really have any complaints. My waitress could have been a tad more attentive, but it's all good. This is a great spot if you're not necessarily looking to be seen but want a neighborhood favorite. Very comfortable setting. I enjoyed the roasted chicken and sage shrimp. I'd definitely come back."
358756,2014-09-28,921,27007,1,4,Great atmosphere and good food.
358757,2014-08-09,921,161024,1,4,The perfect way to. Spend a Saturday night .. Clean and cozy perfect atmosphere for an intimate night with your significant other..delicious wings. & Henry makes a mean drink.. So happy to have found a local spot we can enjoy
358758,2014-12-13,921,161025,1,5,"Great local bar with a cozy atmosphere (fireplace going during winter), super friendly bartenders and staff, not too cramped or crowded, excellent food. Always my go-to spot for any night of the week. Best in the neighborhood!"
358759,2014-12-11,921,161026,1,5,"This cozy Brooklyn restaurant is for sure a win no matter what, either if you're swinging by for lunch, brunch, Happy Hour or dinner. With one of the most knowledgeable wait staffs in the industry, you will be guided through their delicious menu of delicious meals & divine desserts while you soak up the ambiance. The vibe is unrivaled and on the weekends you can swing by and grab the amazing Bijantini from the bar or enjoy the other great drinks that are available. Bijan's is defiantly a keeper!"
358760,2014-12-02,921,161027,1,5,"I wanna let you in on one of Brooklyn's best kept secrets. I am a resident of Chelsea one of New York best bar & restaurant scenes. But it can get loud and crazy due to it being a tourist attraction. I wanted to try something different low key and quaint. So a friend told me about Bijan's. My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night. And to my surprise the spot was Fabulous! The atmosphere was amazing, the decor was on point, very chic and cozy. We sat at the bar  and we were greeted by their bartender Henry. Henry was the perfect host! He was charming attentive and is a master mixologist !! He made me a drink ,with wine and other little special ingredients. The drink was Delish! He also suggested the margarita pizza. It was fresh and delicious!!  The bars owners came up to us, and introduced themselves. They were a very charming couple. To add to this wonder experience it was ladies night. They had an awesome DJ! Overall, the prices, the atmosphere and the service get an A+ from us !!! Bijan's is lucky to have a wonder staff member like Henry!! He went above and beyond. We will definitely become regulars at the quaint place. Thank you Bijan's for the great experience! And thank you Henry for your great Service !"
358761,2014-10-30,921,161028,1,5,"BIJANS is the BEST!!! I love it here. First let me say the drinks are on POINT!! The food is divine and the environment is so welcoming. I go to bijans maybe like once a week, because the people are just so warm and welcoming. The bartenders are friendly and quick with making those delicious ""give me more"", ""pom pom', and my favorite ""the bijan"" drinks! The food... OH MY GOODNESS, I LOVE THE PERSIAN CHICKEN WINGS!!! The yogurt and herbs is also an amazing dish, oh and the crack soup delicious! The desserts always have these freshly cut fruits (tirimusu)... IM IN LOVE! Lets just say the cooks know how to throw down in that kitchen.The owners Johan and Sepideh are amazingly wonderful people, that bend over backwards just make sure you feel welcome and comfortable. A typical visit to Bijans: Walk in and get greeted with a smile, from one of the many attractive people workng there. They will say hello and i will either sit at the bar or at one of the tables (usually the bar). I will get a glass of water and a menu, after at most 10 minutes I will get to place my order and within an a 15 minute time period (at most) I will recieve a nice meal, and my drinks that I've order. The waitresses never messed up my order and they were always energetic and affable. After I am done with my meal, I am able to enjoy little conversations with the bartenders. I will encourage anyone who likes good afforable drinks, delicious food, sociable people and an comfortable environment, this is the place to go."
358762,2014-09-25,921,161029,1,5,"I had a stop-over in New York last weekend and a friend recommended Bijan's - I fell in love with the rustic, modern and cozy decor! The food was great and the staff very accommodating - I wish they had a place like this near me in London!"
358763,2014-09-22,921,161030,1,5,Great neighbourhood bar where you immediately feel like a local. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area although be careful - you may not want to leave!
358764,2014-09-21,921,161031,1,5,"My friend and I were visiting Brooklyn and decided to stop by this restaurant as it seemed to have a unique feel to it, especially on a busy saturday. The atmosphere was great and the owners were lovely. We were not disappointed, the Persian starters were delicious and authentic,  and the mains superb- moist succulent meats in ample portions. Will go again if we visit New York again. Staff remain friendly even under pressure."
358765,2014-08-14,921,161032,1,5,"I really enjoyed this place, the persian wings were spiced perfect not too hot, I liked the Bijan their namesake cocktail it was tropical and had a bite from the cayenne, the tiramisu was really amazing with a nice latte. The music was good trendy hipsterish and the place was decorated in an artsy bohemian style befitting the eclectic heir of the menu"
358766,2014-08-12,921,161033,1,5,"I recently found myself hanging in Brooklyn for the day, and my friend Toni and I wound up at Bijan's at the recommendation of a colleague.  While I usually follow my own favorites, I'm glad I listened this time. The space has a creative vibe and being an artist, I loved that they had abstract impressionism on display.  Didn't even pick up a menu yet and I was like ""yessss, like that"".   The specialty cocktails are inventive (and tasty).  I don't usually go for a second drink (lightweight!) but I indulged this time, haha. I had the Lime Sumac Chicken and it was amazing, just right. For dessert, I had the Tiramisu, which I was told is a family recipe.  Verdict: To. Die. For. The service was great and how I like it: casual, efficient and not overbearing.  Also bonus was the music selection: eclectic yet fun.   I'll definitely be back!!"
358767,2014-08-09,921,98465,1,5,"This is my favorite go-to spot in the neighborhood for happy hour or late night cocktails as well as a casual dinner.  The happy hour is fabulous with great wines as well as fantastic cocktails (2 for 1!).   And I know I can never go wrong with the sumac chicken or the double-cut pork chop (if that's available on special). I do have to give a special shout-out to my favorite bartender, Henry.  He made sure to reach out to me one of the first times I sat in the restaurant.  The second time I arrived, he remembered not only my ams, but the type of drink I liked.  He has a way of making people feel special, therefor making the bar/restaurant feel special."
358768,2014-07-29,921,161034,1,5,"Everything was delightful. Perfect atmosphere, friendly staff, combined with delicious melds of flavors! Bravo Bijan! I had the bijan cocktail, the shiraz salad, and the pear arugula flatbread."
358769,2014-07-20,921,80019,1,5,last night I stopped in and had the best persian beef kabobs in NYC the bartender was extremely busy and still so sweet and attentive! great late night bite as I was leaving a dj was setting up the crowd looked like they were in for the long haul
358770,2014-07-17,921,161035,1,5,"OH LAWRD!!   Perfect, Perfect and Perfect!  Have you ever had the Persian chicken wings?  Oh, me neither!  I am vegetarian, so I've never had the experience that everyone seem to talk about all the time there.  Anyways, the White pizza is my favorite and the drinks are consistently made with real Brooklyn prices. All these edge Brooklyn places think they are on Park Ave or something. Just saying... I never knew how many people really used Yelp. I never thought my opinion mattered and really it doesn't in the grand schema of things. If by chance it does to you, go check it out for yourself.  I think you'll have nearly the same opinion as I, even if it doesn't really matter. Good job Bijan!"
358771,2014-05-20,921,161036,1,5,While waiting at bar to get a table I encountered possibly the best bartender I have ever met.( and I've met a lot) Henry was funny and made a great drink The time flee by and when my table was ready we decided to stay and eat at the bar I think it found my new hangout Thanks Henry
358772,2014-05-16,921,161037,1,5,"Food was great. Service was amazing. Our server Henry was attentive, accommodating, and made eating at Bijans a great experience. I wish there were more waiters out there like him. We will be returning soon. 5 stars for service and food."
358773,2014-05-15,921,161038,1,5,"great food, good drinks, wonderful time."
358774,2014-05-03,921,99699,1,5,"So... Ive tried to write many reviews of this place and its making me feel like Yelp is only for the BAD reviews... I'm seriously thinking this.  Anyway, again...  This place is amazing!!!!  It is my favorite place in the neighborhood to go to!!!  For Dinner... Brunch... Lunch!!!  They are just great!  If you all take the time to look under ""un recommended reviews"" at the bottom of the page, you will see how many people love this place and how the FEW uncultured and fake people get to have their reviews posted for recommended... come on yelp, let us real foodies speak our mind!!!!"
358775,2014-03-06,921,161039,1,5,Deliciousness- chicken wings and pulled pork sandwiches. Craft cocktails made by Alex. Everyone here is so nice- ask for Rena for great service. Best spot in the area.
358776,2013-07-31,921,161040,1,5,"Delicious meal in a great atmosphere on a cute street. I ate the yogurt and herbs, the persian spiced chicken wings and the pappardelle. I had the jalepeno margarita too. The yogurt an herb dish was delicious - it reminded me of the mos'o'khiar my mother would make. The chicken wings were cooked so that they were tasty and crunchy instead of greasy and fatty. And the pappardelle was delicious (I love shiitake mushrooms!). The jalepeno margarita was super spicy but I love spicy drinks so I highly recommend it. Overall I highly recommend Bijan's!"
358777,2013-05-01,921,161041,1,5,"Whenever I have a friend in town, we visit Bijan's because the the 2-for-1 cocktail happy hour can't be beat.  The cocktails are original and unique, featuring ingredients like basil and cayenne pepper.  It's got a Brooklyn feel with all of the plants in the window, local art on the walls and the real fireplace.  I've never stayed for dinner but the mezes and flatbreads are really yummy."
358778,2013-04-26,921,77482,1,5,"The bartender was  very sweet and funny, as   was the waitress.  im helping open a real estate office on atlantic and I have been checking out the area for food spots, I had a great meal for under $15.00 and happy hour -2 for 1- til 7 pm what a treat !! Ill be back for sure!!! The 2 Bijanis  were great dont tell my boss!!"
358779,2012-08-09,921,161042,1,5,"Fantastic spot!  Great drinks, great staff.  Cool, laid back atmosphere.  Highly recommend it if you're feeling like you just want to relax and have a good time."
358780,2012-07-31,921,161043,1,5,"This place is amazing, I loved it so much that  i have been back many times and brought lots of friends with me .We all love this place .Food is amazing .Sunday brunch is so reasonably priced, Love their pizza , The drinks are so tasty ,Staff very friendly. I am glad this place is in brooklyn and near me."
358781,2012-06-12,921,161044,1,5,"I love this place. Drinks are great, atmosphere is unique, fun and inviting, and the staff is awesome. Certain nights they have live music like Jazz or DJs. Anyone living close by owes it to themselves to make this place a regular haunt. Hell, I'm going after I write this review. Drinks: Strong, extremely flavorful Food: Wings are the best I've ever had - and I eat a lot of wings. Pizzas are okay, Burger's are best when ordered medium rare."
358782,2012-01-12,921,161045,1,5,I work for a local nonprofit and we were so lucky to have a delicious donated lunch from Bijan's today.  The pasta with mushroom sauce and the grilled vegetables were fantastic!  I wish we could enjoy and provide our clients with food this amazing every day. Thank you Bijan's!!
358783,2011-12-01,921,161046,1,5,"Bijan is the best bar I have been to in Brooklyn so far. No joke. There is something downright mesmerizing about the vibe there- spectacular ambience, cocktails, and the most personable bartenders (Larry and Megan) that I have yet to encounter."
358784,2011-11-15,921,161047,1,5,Great local lounge spot! After work and regular nights have had a great time here. Awesome bar tenders and cocktails...Also have seen some amazing dj sets here weekends!
358785,2015-01-05,921,12847,0,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I've ordered delivery and sat down to order, both were still delicious. Definitely get the steak frites. When those squishy fries fall into the flavorful juices seeping from your medium rare steak and soak up the seasoning and meaty goodness into their potato-y bodies like a sponge, you'll be glad your ordered that dish. They are super good at brunch as well. $15 for an entree, tea/coffee and a cocktail!"
358786,2014-12-26,921,6815,0,3,"Been here a couple times for brunch as a walk in. Both times have been seated right away and its worth noting that they are kid friendly. They also have TVs and play the football games, which keeps my husband happy during sunday brunch. This place is really small and has an interesting ambiance. It sort of reminds me of a place you could find in the South. Sort of like a welcoming  tavern, cute, intimate, but just an atmosphere that is hard to pinpoint. There are some shared tables and a bar, and some private tables. The service has always been attentive and friendly. The drinks are very good, im a fan of the brunch cocktails. The food, I would say, has been for me, not great. I got the pancakes once because they looked so good on someone else's plate, and they were ""whatever"". Another time I got the Persian omlette, which was also just ok. Niether were bad, but definitely wouldn't say they were good either.  People I was with got the breakfast pizza/flatbread thing, and they seemed to really enjoy that. Sweet potatoe fries also good. Also, the $15 brunch deal is pretty good. You get a cocktail, a meal, and a coffee/tea. Note that the brunch is cash only... Overall, for brunch it is easy (no line, kid friendly, inexpensive...), but not a place that you cant wait to go back to."
358787,2014-12-10,921,96688,0,3,"Bad service, decent food. Came here for a late weekday lunch with my father. The lamb burger was more cooked than I ordered, a little dry, but good flavor. His salmon salad sandwich was also a little dry. Worse, two sandwiches took 30 minutes to come out. Nobody came to take our order, for that matter, we had to go up to the bar. Our water wasn't refilled a single time while we were there. Plenty of places nearby are better."
358788,2014-12-03,921,161048,0,5,"From the ambience, to the service, to the drinks & food, this has become one if my favorite spots in Brooklyn. The food is AMAZING! Have not had one thing I didn't enjoy. My faves are the burger, the chicken breast, the steak frites, and the truffle mashed potatoes. Henry the bartender is wonderful and make great drinks!! A must go in Brooklyn!!!"
358789,2014-10-31,921,161049,0,5,"My wife and I had heard of Bijan's before but never had the chance to eat there till last week. The interior is really warm and friendly where we sat for an hour or two ordering drinks before looking at the menu. One of the waitresses recommended several appetizers which we absolutely loved. My wife is vegetarian and I'm not but the menu served us both. For the main course I had the chicken and my wife ordered the thin pizza. I believe they make their own bread! We both enjoyed the service and highly recommend it to our friends. It's a relax environment to hang out with friends and enjoying each other's company with many tasty options on the menu. Since I live near by, I think I'd make this a regular place to visit."
358790,2014-10-25,921,161050,0,4,"My lunch experience yesterday wasn't necessarily the best I've ever had but our server, Henry, did everything he could to make sure we were okay. He was obviously very busy and the restaurant was dealing with some sort of technical difficulties. The music kept going on and off. I ordered the Persian Chicken Salad Sandwich and my husband ordered the lamb burger. It definitely took longer than it should have to come out but Henry was so nice and he kept talking to us assuring us that it would be out soon. When it finally did make it to our table everything was delicious:). When we asked for our check we were informed that the computers were down so we had to pay cash which was a little annoying because I like to earn my rewards points but what can you do. Overall it was a bit of a long lunch but our server showed us that good customer service can make up for a lot! Thanks, we will definitely be back!"
358791,2014-10-23,921,43161,0,4,"kudos to Alex behind the bar, who was able to stir up a few decent margaritas for me while fending off advances from the creeper on my right. bummed that i wasn't able to try the food - hopefullly, next time."
358792,2014-10-22,921,161051,0,5,"Magnificent food, good ambience. As an Iranian, I find the fusion, Persian-inspired cuisine very well balanced. Don't miss out on the cocktails too!"
358793,2014-10-22,921,120917,0,5,The burgers are awesome!! I like the food and the price is very reasonable. I had their burger and had a drink which they do pretty good as well. If you ever get hungry for lunch check this place out you won't regret it.
358794,2014-10-17,921,119440,0,5,"Beautiful interior, good vibes, tasty food, lovely cocktails. Had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners tonight and she was so welcoming and gracious. I will definitely be back!!!"
358795,2014-10-12,921,161052,0,2,I stopped in here with my hubby for a drink before dinner. I'd been with friends many months ago and remembered a fun cocktail menu. I ordered a martini and he ordered an old fashioned. They were both terrible. The old fashioned was way too sweet and totally watered down. My gin martini had ice in it and way too much citrus. The bartenders were distracted and the service was poor. We won't be back.
358796,2014-10-11,921,6848,0,2,Decent food HORRIBLE service. It took us over an hour to get our food. The Persian omelette had very little of all the ingredients I asked for in it except dates.
358797,2014-10-07,921,2126,0,5,Very nice food with a touch of Persian spice. Lamb burger is very good and Salmon with pistachios crust was unique taste.
358798,2014-09-28,921,73772,0,2,Food was great but incredibly slow! We wait an hour for a burger and a sandwich! and the place was not full.
358799,2014-09-27,921,48565,0,3,"I went here for dinner. The drink I got was good, though maybe a couple dollars overpriced. I enjoyed my entree, a goat cheese arugula pizza. Unfortunately my dinner partner really wasn't impressed by her burger and I have to admit her fries (I stole one) were pretty bland.  It's hard to mess up fries.  The service was friendly but quite slow, and it took a long time to get our food. Overall, it was ok and I might come back, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. I did like the decor and general atmosphere though - it's a cute place."
358800,2014-09-07,921,161053,0,1,"This place is terrible.  The service is painfully slow.  Our order came out wrong, and the waitress did not handle it well.  The ambiance, decor, and menu are all lackluster.  If you're in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and walk one more block to Mile End or across the street to Fast & Fresh Burrito.   The food and service at both are excellent, and even though Mile End often has a wait you will still get served faster than at Bijan's."
358801,2014-08-27,921,161054,0,5,"I can't say enough good stuff about this place...it's my favorite neighborhood hang, and I don't even live in the neighborhood! LOVE the Persian-inspired menu...from the wings to the steak to the mezes; I've yet to have a less than stellar meal. And the servers...warm, funny and make everyone feel like a regular. I can't stop coming back; it's well worth the trip!"
358802,2014-08-24,921,76695,0,3,"We decided to give Bijan a try last night after a festival in Brooklyn. We wound up leaving pretty late and figured it would be best to grab a bite before our ride back to the city, and were pretty eager to try the food after browsing their menu.  Upon arrival, my first thought was that the atmosphere was pretty decent. However, though the hostess came to assist us within seconds, I was a little turned off by the fact that she had food in her mouth, which she was chewing in my face as she spoke.  I understand the struggle of food service, but seriously, next time get someone to cover you while you take a five minute break to eat. Seating was a bit annoying as well. When we arrived there were a number of empty tables available, as there were only a handful of people there. It would've been easy to separate one of the four person arrangements to give us a single table, but apparently that was out of the question. Instead, we were seated in the corner, on a bench which wasn't exactly comfortable or sturdy, that moved whenever anyone else on it moved. To their credit, our waitress was okay. She was at our table pretty frequently to take orders and check in.  As to food and drinks,  there were some things I truly enjoyed and others I could live without.  For my cocktail, I ordered the Pom Pom - voodka, triple sec, lime juice, and pomegranate nectar - which I found to be light/crisp, refreshing, and very well suited for summer.     My gf went with a gingerale.  While we both appreciated the fact that you could definitely taste the ginger, their ratio of syrup to seltzer were off and the soda was pretty sweet. For food, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which came with sweet potato fries. The fries were delicious. They were thinly cut, crisp around the edges, but soft in the middle, and the perfect balance of salty and sweet.  The sandwich also had very good flavors, but was a little on the  chewy and, at times, dry side.  Unlike the traditional pulled pork sandwich which is often served with a little extra sauce, Bijan's sandwich came served on brioche (which is fairly thick), with no extra sauce, and with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and a spicy pickle.  Being the traditionalists that I am, I did without the added toppings, and ate the sandwich and pickle separately.  And, though the meat had a great BBQ flavor (sweet with a bit of a kick), I could only make it through about a third of the sandwich before I couldn't bear it anymore.  On the other hand, my gf ordered the goat cheese, arugula,  and pear flatbread.   Again, the flavors were there, but for me the goat cheese was chewy.  Perhaps it was the type or brand of goat cheese they used. All in all, our experience wasn't terrible.  If ever in the area, I could see myself stopping in again for cocktails, but I don't see Bijan being the type of place that makes feel the need to travel to BK specifically for the purpose of eating here."
358803,2014-08-13,921,80257,0,5,"I've lived in the neighborhood for years now and love this place. Bijan's has a great vibe, the food is good, they have live music and in the winter they keep the fireplace going! Did I mention the great drinks...what more can you ask for?   I  go  to relax and unwind after work or for lunch when Im working from home, yes occasionally the service is slow but  the atmosphere is always welcoming and the food is consistently good.  Overall Im glad they are here and will continue to recommend them to friends."
358804,2014-08-12,921,161055,0,5,"Really great place in the heart of downtown Brooklyn, Bijan's somehow is able to straddle the nearly invisible line between great food and can't-be-beat Brooklyn prices. The cocktails in particular are stupendous, with a seven hour HH that is somehow longer than the the ""regular priced"" drinks. I also really like that all of the bartenders are very chill, relatable people, who can be themselves and still make a great drink. Get the chicken wings and the Lamb burger!!!!"
358805,2014-08-09,921,144949,0,2,"I've been here 3 times, each time hoping the service would be better. It wasn't. The first time I came with my fiancé for dinner. HOLY SLOW. Took about 1.5 hours and we only ordered a cocktail and an entree each. They took our menus away before we even ordered, somebody came back about 15 minutes later to basically ask what we were doing there -obviously they forgot that had seated us and that we needed to order food, the wait for the food to come out was also ridiculously long, and we had to ask 3 times to get the cocktails we ordered. The worst part was that it is a small restaurant and you can see the waitstaff. The entire time our waitress was just at the bar texting and talking to someone else that worked there. The second time I came back with a friend for brunch, hoping that the slow service the first time was just an anomaly. It was not. I was feeling okay about coming back because the brunch deal is actually super good for the price and includes a drink, entree, and coffee/tea (but is cash only, which they only tell you after you've been seated). The lamb burger was actually delicious, the flatbread was meh. I really do like the cocktails, but it took us about 15 minutes once our glasses were empty to try to flag her down to get a refill, and then another 10 minutes to get the glasses filled. I would've had a third but having to try to wave down the waitress for 15 minutes to get another one didn't seem worth it. They forgot to give us (or even ask if we wanted) the coffee/tea, and once again did not want to bother trying to get the waitress' attention. The third (and last) time I came in, I came in with a friend to grab a quick cocktail. We asked for a drink menu at the bar and they handed us the menu, we looked and saw the cocktails were $5 each so we thought luck was in our favor. It was not. Again. We got a drink each and handed the bartender a $20, who then looked at us like we were aliens for waiting there, and dismissively said ""okay, you can go"". We asked about the prices on the menu and he said well that price is for brunch only. While it's totally understandable that they have brunch pricing on drinks, but that doesn't change the fact that they gave us a menu with different prices on it and didn't say anything until after we got our drinks. I really wanted to like this place because it's so close to where I live, but it's definitely not good enough to deal with the bad wait staff and the slow service."
358806,2014-08-07,921,45507,0,3,"Me and my coworker visited here lunch time when there were just a few customers, and those were mostly sitting at the bar. I chose to sit at the table with the bench and the bartender would do the waiting.  Actually, we were the ones doing the waiting as the food took way too long to arrive. I had a chuckle when I saw my hungry, bewildered coworker with a pained face scratch his folded arms out of frustration, resembling a crack head in a dire need of a fix.  I had to be pro active at the end of the meal in finalizing the transaction because we were very close to returning late to work. When the food finally arrived, my lamb burger was over-cooked.  I ordered a medium and then noted on the check later on it was assigned medium-well.  Even the wrong call on my order was prepared wrong - the burger was definitely well done.   I guess this explains the wait : they were too busy over-cooking the burger!  This is a shame because as I recall from visiting here once before, when the order was taken and cooked the way I wanted, the burger was excellent.   The sweet potato fries were outstanding and the 2 for $10 happy hour medicinals make a pretty good bargain.  The drink that carries the name of the restaurant was the most enjoyable - loved the cayenne pepper in it. The unconventional interior design is a weird mesh-up of various sets of tables and chairs and benches.  The abstract art on the wall only adds to the identity crisis."
358807,2014-07-16,921,161056,0,5,"Oh. My. Gosh.  The food... The drinks... topped off by the comfortable, casual, hip atmosphere.  I am still savoring the basil shrimp, the sumac chicken with truffle mashed potatoes, and the Gimme More Vodka cucumber deliciousness.  I could easily eat here every night and never tire of it..."
358808,2014-07-16,921,161057,0,5,"Honestly this has been one of the best meals I have had in a LONG time. I came with several friends and we ordered a little of everything and everyone was very happy. We had the basil shrimp (twice), mixed olives, and calamari for apps. They were all very good for different reasons. The connecting thread is that everything was so well prepared. Out drinks were great (their Gimme More was especially good). I ordered the steak and it was perfectly cooked and the truffle fries that went with them were good. The salads were awesomely fresh and delicious. The staff was friendly, but honestly, even if they cursed me out, the food would have made up for it."
358809,2014-07-09,921,161058,0,5,Love the good and the drinks! Happy hour great deal till 7pm (2 for 1 cocktails). Calamari with awesome curry sauce. Had Lamb burger and truffle fries! You can never flog wrong with truffle fries!!
358810,2014-07-07,921,1814,0,3,"++++ - I like the price fixe brunch menu (Although, they are very stringent on substitutions) ++ - Persian bee and pomengrante kiss were refreshing - Wife got the lamb burger, as the reviews noted, it was very good - Seasoned fries were a plus - I always dig free coffee refills - It was pretty empty on a Sunday around noon, I there was one other table being occupied + - Steak salad was nice and juicy (Just a personal opinion, but I would have liked something extra, like a cheese, tomato, or nut) TIP: - CASH ONLY!!! - the fries are not sweet potato fries, they are some seasoned regular fries"
358811,2014-07-05,921,66392,0,5,Bijan's is one of those places where everything just works. The bartenders are attentive and splendid conversationalists; the service staff are keen and friendly; the food is intriguing and tasty. It doubles as a great neighborhood bar and an exceptional restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood.
358812,2014-07-05,921,41768,0,4,"Great brunch spot. The $15 price fix which includes a drink is a great deal. The food was solid, I personally like the very crisp bacon, but I know some people like it a bit chewier. Blood Mary's were terrific, spicey with various pickles as garnish."
358813,2014-06-30,921,3448,0,1,"And it's time to downgrade my previous review. I've now come to this restaurant 3 times, once for dinner on a Friday evening, once for drinks and dessert late on a Saturday night and once for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The service has been consistently terrible every time (though the server has been different each time). The Monday afternoon lunch was the final straw. The restaurant was fairly empty with maybe a handful of other patrons around. There was a hostess, a waitress and a bartender none of which paid much attention to my husband and I. The waitress disappeared at some point and didn't return so I guess her shift was over. After quite a bit of time the bartender took our order. I ordered the crack soup which gives you the option of chicken broth or spicy broth and choice of meat. I had ordered regular chicken broth with no meat. A ridiculous amount of time passed. My husband got his burger. No new people came into the restaurant. Some more time passed. I finally got my soup. It was with spicy broth and chicken. Two things wrong with this simple order! Another 5-7 minutes passed before I could get the attention of the bartender. His back was always turned to the room. Maybe he was printing receipts on the computer or something but that's just poor placement of the computer then. Check up on your tables once in awhile! I finally got his attention and told him what was wrong with the order. He seemed just as annoyed with the kitchen as I was and took the soup back. Another ridiculous amount of time passed. My husband was long done with his lunch. I finally got my soup and ate it. This is the most disappointing part about this restaurant. I actually like their food! We got the check and noticed that my $2 tea was comped. That's a nice gesture but unfortunately not enough to compensate for the 2 hour long lunch which should have taken maybe 40 minutes. I can't imagine how frustrated I would have been with the experience had I actually had to go somewhere after lunch, like back to work! Three strikes and you're out. Sorry Bijan, wish you were better."
358814,2014-06-23,921,161059,0,5,"Ahhhh Bijans..... The first bar I visited on my move from Australia to New York. This place is filled with the most lovely and interesting people....... friends for life!!! The food - 9/10 and I am picky with my food. If you are after a chilled day or night with some great food and drinks, you will struggle to find a better place in my opinion."
358815,2014-06-21,921,161060,0,1,"Bad service, they told us no dinner till 5 but were serving dinner to other guests. We decided to go but an automatic 25 % gratuity for poor service makes it a one star experience"
358816,2014-06-15,921,161061,0,5,"I have eaten at Bijan's many times and tried almost all the food on the menu and have never been disappointed.  It's hard for me to pick one favorite dish only but I would recommend you to try their PERSIAN SPICED CHICKEN WINGS and GOLDEN SEAFOOD STEW. And if you save room for dessert, try their homemade tiramisu, the best! And if you live in Manhattan, it is easy to get there, the restaurant is just a few blocks from the station. So if you would like to enjoy a cozy restaurant, reasonable prices, and a staff that always makes you feel welcomed, try Bijan's"
358817,2014-06-03,921,161062,0,5,Great little spot in Brooklyn if you are a local or visitor wanting that local connection. Very chill environment. They had great decor with local art work on the wall (the bartender was actually the artist). Menu had a nice variety. I had the baked chicken with a side salad instead of the mashed potatoes and it was excellent. Juicy and flavorful! I had their signature cocktail called the Bijan...great if you want a vodka drink with a kick! Will definitely be back!
358818,2014-05-31,921,161063,0,5,"This place is awesome!  Highly recommend! Food, drinks, music, you name it!  Ask for Henry, he is the best!!!!"
358819,2014-05-21,921,113571,0,4,"Came for happy hour on a Tuesday. It was pretty empty, but a few more people came in later. Sat at the bar, which had hooks for purses and bags! Also, the happy hour special was 2 drinks from a certain cocktail menu for $10, only with the same person. So we had 4 drinks for $20, which wasn't bad. They're unusual cocktails, so be prepared to try something new. The bartender was really cool, so I would go back."
358820,2014-05-14,921,161064,0,4,I really like this place!! I love the atmosphere and the decor.  The 2 for 1 happy special is great and the drinks are really good.  In terms of food I ordered the pistachio crusted salmon and it came with mashpotatos and string beans.  The salmon was cooked really well. I would like to comeback and try the lamb burger
358821,2014-05-08,921,160984,0,1,"I'm eating my meal as I type this. This place, at least from my only (and last) experience here, really sucks. The ""Persian"" chicken salad sandwich tastes like it came from 7-11 and the chips are stale. Legitimately stale. Chewy. Add to that the fact that it took OVER A HALF HOUR for this cold sandwich to be brought out to me...and you've got yourself one unhappy customer. The guy at the counter is wearing a baseball cap, grey t-shirt, and Addidas gym pants. He looks like he just woke up. I'm beyond not impressed. Never again."
358822,2014-04-26,921,161065,0,2,"We had a large table and there was literally as minimal service as possible (20% gratuity rule abuse I presume). The table had empty glasses all around for the majority of the evening. The food is alright, nothing special with little variety. Stick to the bar."
358823,2014-04-23,921,161066,0,5,"Five stars folks!!! You heard me!!! So let's be honest, New York. You can drink anywhere. What we are looking for is good people, great service, and a cocktail that is the real deal. So come to Bijans! Just come. Ask the bartender to make your fav drink. Yeah, the bartender with the warm brown eyes and the dimples... His name is Alex! He's friendly and fun, and he mixes a mean Frisky Whisky! The whole fam is great! Just come already. But leave your hoity-toity Manhattan attitude at home. This is Brooklyn...we're chill! Written by the girl who lives around the corner and freakin LIVES in this place!!!!"
358824,2014-04-23,921,161067,0,5,"Absolutely love this place!!!! The wings are to die for! The pistachio crusted salmon is one of the best options on the dinner menu, and the drinks... Two for one happy hour... Pure awesomeness! When I walked in Friday night, I was instantly greeted by the staff, they're so nice and friendly. The place was dimly lit, with tealight candles on the tables and great music, setting a cozy and friendly atmosphere. I was served by Kadri and she was such a doll. She greeted us with a smile and made sure everything was great and we were content. The bartender Alex was also awesome, all along friendly guy. Great place to go relax, have great food and drinks, and leave with a smile on your face. What else could you ask for???"
358825,2014-04-21,921,161068,0,1,"Order was screwed up, in addition the lamb burger ordered medium showed up rare and bloody (the server promptly fixed both of these problems). The beet salad was made with what tasted like canned beets, and the shrimp with spaghetti squash was exceedingly mediocre.  And then we saw a mouse..."
358826,2014-04-19,921,6067,0,2,"I have mixed feeling about my brunch at Bijan's. We arrived at 11 am, but the staff complained that they couldn't open up yet because of a late waitress. We came back 20 minutes later to get a seat. Unprepared management, unhappy staff. Not the best way to start your morning. The space is charming in a cozy Brooklyn meets Bedouin kinda way. Its rustic, but industrial, and filled with lots of kitsch, succulent plants, and modern art pieces. There are small tables, as well as one long communal table. If the place is full, it would feel very crowded. Our tables and chairs were very wobbly, which drove the OCD in me a little crazy. The lack of uniformity and polish actually makes the place look a bit gritty. I ordered the: Lemonade Saffron semolina pancakes Lamb burger Coffee (which the poor staff kept complaining was going to be a tiny bit of a wait because SOMEBODY didn't show up on time, and wasn't she so sorry that SOMEBODY was completely ruining her day) The pancakes sucked. They tasted like baking soda, not like saffron. They were remedied only by the blueberry compote on top. But if you can't serve a pancake that tastes good on its own, you shouldn't be serving it. However, Perry absolutely loved his lamb burger with feta. He polished it off faster than your momma can say your full name. So his happiness with his meal counters mine. I can see how this place would be awesome for cocktails and lounging around. But that's not why I was here. The service was whiny. The unprepared opening. The pancakes. So this gets a giant MEH from me."
358827,2014-04-14,921,7088,0,5,"Alex rocks, he's the bar-tender who serves excellent drinks and really is all around a great service pro. The food was excellent (Lamb Burger, Wings) both very tasty. Overall I would highly recommend this place.."
358828,2014-03-21,921,161069,0,5,"This spot is a rare GEM.  I went here for Happy Hour and Dinner with my friend on a Thursday night.  The drinks were well made by the awesome bartender, not watered down at all.  He smiled and even sparked up a conversation with me after only me being their a minute; I wish I would have gotten his name.  Our waitress was Jaimee and she was by far very personable, knowledgeable about the food and was able to handle the growing dinner crowd without a blink of an eye.  She really made the night more enjoyable because she was attentive.  Now onto the food; the basil shrimp and spaghetti squash was delectable, the wings had just the right amount of sauce both appetizers were portioned to share.  The lamb burger was well seasoned and overall delish!!"
358829,2014-03-09,921,144556,0,3,"It was cool. If I'm in the neighborhood I might stop by again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. The food was delicious when we finally got it, but the portion sizes were small considering the price."
358830,2014-03-07,921,161070,0,5,Love love LOVE Bijans especially HENRY!! He's the best!! We talk for hours!!!! Oh and the food is DELICIOUS too!!
358831,2014-03-06,921,161071,0,5,"Hands down best place for happy hour and appetizers in Downtown Brooklyn! Great atmosphere, a breath of fresh air in comparison to Fulton street. 2 for 1 happy hour. Rena and Alex are amazing!!"
358832,2014-03-05,921,11754,0,5,"Want to be on stage? Literally This place gives you those 15 minutes of fame...or maybe more, if you opt for a boozy brunch! I came here with some friends and sat at the table that's on a mini stage by the window...waived at passing admirers...perfect Hollywood fix! ;) For a $15 brunch you get a brunch item, coffee or tea and a drink. Drinks are $5 btw (fancy ones too)! The food was delicious! I had the breakfast pizza and ginger-rita! Definitely heading back there soon"
358833,2014-02-18,921,32638,0,4,Nice warm fire place on a cold winter night.  Quaint rustic decor and good bartender.
358834,2014-01-26,921,161072,0,5,"Food was great and the owner was warm and gracious. I wanted a certain appetizer but it wasn't available so he offered me an alternative. It was different from anything I had ever had but I was enjoying the other dishes more and couldn't finish it. He offered to take it off the tab since I didn't enjoy it as much. I appreciated the gesture which shows he cares about people truly liking the food. Speaking of which, the vegetable grill bread and chicken wings were fantastic! Also, the fireplace adds a cozy feel to the whole space that is perfect on a chilly night. My friend and I hung out there a little longer than we should have but never felt rushed or pressured to leave. Excellent meal and great hospitality!"
358835,2014-01-17,921,161073,0,4,"I like Bijans. They have a good happy hour, the menu is not big but everything is good, and the drinks are affordable. The space is small but it's not uncomfortable. Sometimes they have live music. But the service if you are sitting at a table is usually really slow. I like the Lamb Burger and the Grillbreads. Very reasonably priced."
358836,2014-01-15,921,3347,0,5,"Bijan's is a lovely, unassuming cocktail bar-cum-cafe in a pretty unassuming and unexpected part of Downtown Brooklyn. It was a birthday drinks and more stop for us after a group archery session at Hidden Gem a few blocks away. The place was funky and hip, but in that totally acceptable New Brooklyn way. There's art all around, exposed brick walls, and a fireplace to cap it all off. It was the weekend of the big snowstorm, which probably kept a lot of folks home, but that SUnday night was nice and mellow. Only a couple of other tables were occupied in the early evening, and a large table was already set up for us. Cocktails were spot on, and all flat priced at $10. I tried the Bijan's--vodka with pineapple, mint, elderflower, and cayenne, a delicious elixir full of nice contrasts. Alas, a cocktail is a short-lived beverage, so I switched to beer thereafter (there's a few nice ones to pick). The food was also way above average. We started with some very tasty dips (the place has Iranian roots, after all). Then I moved on to a lamb burger with sweet potato fries (good carbs and whatnot!), both delicious. Others seemed please with the regular burger and other treats. Everyone was thrilled with the place, and I have Yelp and a squadron of savvy Brooklyn Yelpers to thank for it. Hope to be back sometime, this place is really wonderful."
358837,2014-01-13,921,74128,0,5,"TO DIE FOR food. We ordered the salmon, steak frites and pork chop special: WOW They were stellar. The drinks were unique. I had the jalapeño margarita which was different, in a good way - not too sweet & just the right amount of heat from the jalapeño. It was a busy night but we weren't rushed at all. One waitress (who was fantastic) and one bartender, so it was a teeny bit slow but that was no problem! This is a great place to come, hang out, unwind with friends and enjoy some delicious food."
358838,2014-01-03,921,35623,0,4,"Never eaten here, but they always seem to have great brunch drink specials and funky specialty cocktails.  The atmosphere is very chill and the bartenders have always been nice."
358839,2013-12-30,921,2226,0,4,"Though I didn't try the food (yet), my friend and I ended an impromptu Hoyt Street bar crawl at Bijan's for one final drink. Upon the advice of the bartender (who was awesome), we tried two of the whiskey cocktails. The place was pretty quiet, with a few other customers at the bar late on Sunday night, and one table occupied. The bar space was cool, the lighting was romantic, and the music was perfectly chill. It was the perfect end to a fun night out. And I will be back to try some of the food next time! P.S. The bartender called a cab for us, and we really appreciated that level of service!"
358840,2013-12-21,921,161074,0,5,Great neighborhood place. Good food. Very relaxed. Nice place you can just hang out and read a book or something.
358841,2013-11-15,921,12974,0,5,"I stumbled upon this place on a cold afternoon with a friend looking for a bite to eat and an alcoholic drink to warm up with. I wasn't feeling too daring so I had a burger with cheese and a side of their special chips and my friend was recommended the lamb burger by the waitress/bartender. The food was delicious. We were the only customers there, so I can't really comment on the service other than the fact that our waitress whipped up great cocktails for happy hour. I am definitely looking forward to my next visit here."
358842,2013-11-13,921,1246,0,3,"My experience here is met w/ some trepidation. I say that b/c the service for me always makes the experience better. So i'm giving them a 3 star average.  4 stars for the food and 2 for the service. So to start with the 4 star experience of the food. 1st they had $5 brunch cocktails Steak and eggs were delish and my companion had the Persian omelette. We loved the meal even though we didn't want to and this is when I tell you about the 2 star experience.   We waited over 40 mins for food when they were only 6 patrons in the restaurant. How does that happen you ask... by never putting in the order. 3 tables of two we sat down 1st,  ordered 1st,  and got our food last.... ummm not cool. When ask 20 mins in when it was coming out we were told shortly . So 5 mins after that with tail tucked in server informed us that they forgot to put our order in.... and there was no formal apology. The look I had on my face was surely pretty scary b/c the server continued to look at my companion. My companion decided we would stay b/c if i got up i may have started flipping tables. Sadly our drinks weren't comp'd for the crazy wait which would've raised their star level to 4 for handling the situation. Yeah ... that's it..."
358843,2013-11-08,921,161075,0,1,"The service was horrible. The staff was nice enough, but nothing was right. Each order was late, wrong, or forgotten."
358844,2013-11-01,921,161076,0,2,"The two stars would be lower had it not been for a dinner I once had here which was decent. We took out of town friends here for brunch.  Options were not many.  They had no syrup for my friend's pancakes and gave him a little compote instead (he had to ask for more and even then it was just a little).  My vegan friend (I'm first to admit they're annoying to eat with) had nothing to choose from because the chef is apparently inflexible and wouldn't even give him a plain salad for the flat-price of $10 brunch price (I mean, instead of giving him eggs and ham or sausages which would cost a lot more you can't give someone a plain salad with nothing on it??  Seriously?)   The worst part was that they have no refills for coffee.  Seriously?  For a $15 brunch?  I've gone to middle of nowhere towns and had free refills of coffee.  Bijan's cups were tiny, and for $15 you can't give me a second cup of bland coffee?  I.  Just. Need. My. Coffee. In. The. A.m.   Of course my and my fiance's dishes were nothing special.  Probably one of the most unappetizing brunches I've had of all time.   We were embarrassed to have taken our friends here, to be honest. You want my advice?  Give free coffee, it costs nothing.  And give people some options besides what you have, for man's sake.  Or get rid of your chef!"
358845,2013-10-27,921,161077,0,5,Great food and atmosphere! Descent prices and super nice staff. I love coming here whenever I'm in Brooklyn!! Highly recommended!!
358846,2013-10-20,921,161078,0,4,"My friends and I stumbled upon this place one night. We sat for hours, sipping on drinks and having dinner. The staff didn't mind at all that we were there for such a long time, and the service was great. Cute atmosphere, and delicious food."
358847,2013-10-05,921,87468,0,3,"The Staff is lovely. Great cocktails. nice ambiance. The Food was OK, not great. I don't know honeslty if I would ever come back again. Don't try the salmon. It was quite boring and unimpressive."
358848,2013-10-05,921,3466,0,4,"The liquor they have on shelf is a bit scattered, but their cocktails are delicious. A but medicinal, but I do enjoy that. The food was amazing! I wanted to order the fish, but they were out so had the chicken. Lime sumac amazingness. Ordering chicken at great places can surprise you"
358849,2013-10-03,921,33802,0,5,"Came here in July for my birthday with four of my friends. We did Saturday brunch. The food was great. The wings, steak and burger, all good. The drinks were even better. Unique and strong. They even set us up with a round of pickle back shots:) The vibe was very chill, not crowded. Perfect way to start a weekend."
358850,2013-09-30,921,34876,0,4,"Tucked into an unassuming store front right of Atlantic Avenue is one of the cooler bar restaurants of Boerum Hill.  I have mostly come here for happy hour and lunch.  All the sandwiches I have had are delicious and fresh. The cocktails I have had a are expertly mixed, showing off the mixology skills of the bartenders.  The service is prompt and friendly, the prices are reasonable. This place is a must try for lunch, dinner or happy hour."
358851,2013-09-25,921,161079,0,5,The drinks and food are AMAZING! Whenever I visit my sister we come here we call it purple bar because of the decor it's so cute and we always leave happy the happy hour deal is great and wait stuff and bartenders are the best! Definitely recommend.
358852,2013-09-23,921,11794,0,4,"For my 800th review (wow, I really have too much time on my hands) let me review a spot near my work that has some of the best wings I have had in a while! I ordered their Persian Spiced Chicken Wings and it came with a creamy dipping sauce that went perfectly. The wings were crispy and a nice size and full of flavor that you almost didn't need the sauce. I am a sauce fiend tho and I like all things dipping so I gobbled that up as well. My friend had the chopped salad, which he did not enjoy, but for wings, this is the place to be! Cute ambiance too, definitely casual date night worthy and friendly service. Definitely recommend!"
358853,2013-09-21,921,161080,0,1,"Food was good enough but I got awful food poisoning after eating here. Had the baby greens salad, loaded with shallots and onions (onions weren't listed on the menu), papardelle pasta with tomato sauce and mushrooms. The water tasted and smelled funny. Cool ambiance, but I'm never going back!"
358854,2013-09-18,921,11705,0,3,"Been here twice and the service has been very hit and miss. The spaghetti squash and shrimp was good and they have great cocktails...but when it takes 25 mins to get served and your order is wrong upon arrival? Meh, I won't be coming back."
358855,2013-08-28,921,161081,0,3,"Overall just OK, maybe it was an off night for the staff of Bijan. Cold reception by waitress and watered down  jalapeno tequila. Appetizer was basil shrimp and it was alright, but the maim dishes, we had steak and fries and the salmon, left MUCH to be desired. Salty fries and very salty mashed potatoes that had NO truffle as advertised. Bland and overcooked salmon. Steak was fair but not worth the $70 price tag!"
358856,2013-08-26,921,123575,0,5,"Superb. Came in for brunch and loved everything. Service was excellent, drinks were yummy (get the ginger ice tea!) and the food...heaven. I got the bijan burger which was great and my dad got the lamb burger which I though was even better. However, you can't miss the Persian chicken wings. They are the star of the show. Will definitely make my way here again when I'm in the area."
358857,2013-08-25,921,6750,0,4,"i've now been three times -- twice for dinner, once for brunch -- and every visit was pretty good.  the food is quite tasty -- i especially like the flatbread with goat cheese, that's a favorite -- and the cocktails are also good.  i like dinner more than brunch, though -- i had the smoked salmon salad sandwich (try saying that five times fast) and it was good, but didn't blow me away.  however, the prices at brunch are a pretty good bargain: $15 for an entree (a few of the entrees have an additional $5 fee but most are covered), coffee or tea, and a breakfast cocktail.  the prices at dinner are also very reasonable, cocktails are $10 and the food is not only affordable but also easily shareable, so you can split a few plates and keep the cost down even more. overall, it's not an amazing dining experience but it's enjoyable, won't break the bank, and around the corner from where i live, so i'm sure i will be back again.  oh, and service can be spotty -- it was good at brunch today but the second time i was there for dinner, our waitress was difficult to flag down -- so i recommend being prepared to be patient, just in case.  admittedly, the service wasn't so bad that it's keeping me away, but i might try sitting at the bar next time -- that's what i did on my first visit and had great service from the bartender, so that's probably where i'll take my chances next time."
358858,2013-08-24,921,79909,0,5,The brunch here is very good with many food choices as well as great drink options. The staff are very accommodating. We had Rena and she was great!
358859,2013-08-12,921,161082,0,4,Lamb burger is awesome.  The service was excellent.
358860,2013-08-02,921,86302,0,4,What a cool little neighborhood bistro. Its so small that you don't think anything could come out the kitchen that's worth anything. Totally wrong! Some of the best fries I've ever had! The steak was pretty dang good too. My  wife had a lamb burger that was out of this world! The lamb was so juicy and the sauce they put on the burger was outstanding. Nothing but good things to say! Well.... Except for the beer selection. Please get better beer. Henery Weinhard's IPA is AWFUL! At least get a new IPA on tap.
358861,2013-08-01,921,161083,0,4,"A group of my friends and I went to Bijan's for lunch.  We had 3 babies with us, and the waitress was sweet and accommodating.  She helped us find a seat with room for 2 strollers, but wasn't in the way.  The food was great!  I had the salmon and it was delicious!  The service was really great as well.  One of my friends left something at the table and the bus boy actually ran after us to give it to her.  I will definitely return to Bijan for another meal."
358862,2013-08-01,921,3235,0,5,"I've passed by this place several times late at night and have always thought, ""That looks really cool and I need to go there at some point."" Finally made it, and was totally glad I did! The ambiance is great. Wooden tables. Funky art. Fireplace. Tiny performance stage in the corner. I can't just pick one highlight of the meal, but the cocktails are a strong contender. Basically everything's $10 each. I had a whiskey drink with pumpkin spice in it; it was called - get this - PUMP UP THE JAM. Had to order it just for that name alone. I also had the Bijan-Tini, which was spiced up with cayenne. If you can't tell, I love spicy! Also tried my friend's Frisky Whiskey, which was tasty as all heck. Our waitress was awesome and helped me choose the chicken breast as my entree. I was worried it'd be dry. But nope, it was juicy and spiced really well. Fall off the bone tender too. Would definitely recommend it. If you're in the area and looking for a nice cocktail bar or semi-romantic dinner spot, definitely throw Bijan's on the short list. They also play great semi-indie music in the background too!"
358863,2013-07-30,921,161084,0,5,"Food was outstanding and friendly waitress. The Lamb Burger with Bleu Cheese was flavorable beyond belief, The juices dripping were euphoric.The Margherita Grilled Bread was outstanding. Nothing but aces on this place. I would definitely go back"
358864,2013-07-15,921,161085,0,5,"My husband and I went to Bijan's Thursday evening. The food was delicious. The service was excellent. I had the lamb burger which was the best burger I ever ate and the hubby had the special pizza with sugar snap peas, fava beans, fresh tomatoes with goat cheese....delicious! Henry the bartender makes a tasty strong drink and Rena the hostess/waitress was awesome. It was a wonderful date night. Can't wait to go back."
358865,2013-07-13,921,161086,0,5,Great brunch/cocktail deal and some of the best wings in the area. And our waitress (Rena) was awesome!
358866,2013-07-03,921,2760,0,4,"This was everything I wanted from my first trip to Brooklyn: hipsters, trendy decor, creative cocktails and incredible food for reasonable prices. Dinner for three was about $80 including tip, and the food was amazing. Only downside was the slow service, but the waitress made up for it with a round on the house :)"
358867,2013-06-26,921,1934,0,4,What a great little bar tucked away oh Hoyt. We stopped in for a whiskey before heading to the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare and were pleasantly surprised at  their menu. The staff was so much fun and very communicative and they had everything we wanted behind the bar. I hear the lamb burger can't be missed!
358868,2013-06-19,921,161087,0,5,"This has quickly become my favorite brunch spot! For only $15 I get DELICIOUS food, to die for drinks, and a fantastic crew. Rita is my favorite waitress, she rules. Did I menton how cute the building / interior are? Well deserved 5 stars."
358869,2013-06-17,921,161088,0,5,The very first day I moved to Ny I found myself walking down Hoyt st. in delightful awe of the cuteness of the block we were on. I saw that adorable purple spot and knew I had to check it out. It was one of those days where it's 100 degrees and I was literally dripping sweat which is very new for me being from San Francisco. The waitress Rina (love at first sight) immediately brought us a giant jug of ice cold cucumber water told chatted us up a bit and before I knew it she had whipped me up the best (and first) ginger-rita of my life!! I guess the bartender was having some... issues but I think it was a blessing in disguise. oh that ginger-rita!! I think I need one now.
358870,2013-06-11,921,161089,0,5,"Oh Bijan's how I love thee.... First off, dear Iranians, please don't be sad, this is not Persian food. The food is ridiculously good, but don't show up expecting fesenjoon and kabab. It's more Persian fusion- which isn't a thing, but keep an open mind. Bijan's is a great mix of locals and newbies. The food is amazing, the staff is prone to giving hugs and remembering details about your life. My favorite thing is that if you walk in by yourself the bartender will almost always make sure to introduce you to the person next to you. Or maybe my favorite thing is the ""Persian"" Chicken wings....or the hanger steak frites...or is it truffle fries? Or maybe my favorite thing is the Persian kiss...or maybe Henry's Special Cucumber Concotion....or maybe... Or maybe its Kadri or Henry or Alex or Ross or the Ericas .... I guess its all my favorite. The kind of place you can have a low key birthday party, a glass of wine or a nice date at."
358871,2013-06-10,921,161090,0,4,"Have to admit I'm a fan of unusual cocktails,   The ""Pump Up the Jam"" (whiskey, pumpkin spice, stimulating cayenne with ginger ale) is unusual and interesting.  Now drinking the Gin-X (gin and tonic with elderflower liqueur) while completely enjoying the Lime, Sumac, Rosemary Chicken Breast."
358872,2013-06-02,921,161091,0,4,Great place to go for a quick lunch or happy hour. I have been here three times and love the laid back atmosphere and the friendly wait staff (especially Henry). The grill breads and wings are great for sharing and paired with the fun cocktails makes for an awesome happy hour.  The burgers are also fabulous. Look forward to trying more menu items.
358873,2013-05-25,921,11746,0,4,"Great little neighborhood joint. We arrived to Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare a bit early so they sent us over here for a pre-dinner adult beverage. The murals in the walls and wood beams give it some great character, and the staff was friendly. If I lived around here, this would be my go to hang out spot."
358874,2013-05-22,921,27141,0,4,"Mouthgasm: 1. Juicy (not dry) herbed lamb burger on a perfectly plump bun, 2. Persian wings (""whoever made these LOVES their wings,"" I proclaimed), 3. yogurt meze with sumac, and 4. a strong mojito, all set to a rolling playlist of soul and funk classics. Bartender Alex is a cool guy, and the regulars are mellow. Good place for the ladies (and gents) to come for an undisturbed solo drink or meal."
358875,2013-05-21,921,161092,0,5,"Go for the medicinal cocktails, stay for the laughs with Henry! I don't go to Brooklyn much, but when I do this is an absolute must! I stumbled in, one very hungover morning with a friend, and Henry entertained us for hours.....I don't know how he does it, because he managed to juggle everything from drinks to what must've been a dozen orders in the brunch rush and keep us rolling on the floor with his hilarious stories and quips! The pancakes were also amazing! I don't know what they do with their butter, it's got a lemony herb undertone and is delish!"
358876,2013-05-13,921,134488,0,5,Oh my god! Went here for a drink and apps. The calamary apps was so good. The cocktail is so good...for refreshing. The music not to loud. Food is excelent. Service was great. I have a great bartender henry! He made a faboulos drink ever! Defenitely will be back!
358877,2013-05-13,921,161093,0,5,Henry the bartender makes a stop in at Bijans totally worth it.!He's pleasant and funny and makes everything all better after a long day at work. The food is fresh and amazing and the cocktails can't be beat.
358878,2013-05-12,921,161094,0,5,I love everything about this place. I've been going since opening night and try to swing by for a cocktail at least once per week. Food's good too.
358879,2013-05-12,921,140523,0,4,"The staff are always really friendly and welcoming and recognise you as a regular.  A very easy place to go for drinks with friends or on your own. Food is great, bit surprised by some of the negative reviews.  Always had great experience here."
358880,2013-05-01,921,38543,0,1,"Never in my life have I experienced such treatment from a restaurant employee.  Disgusting!  Here is my story... Me, my husband and my daughter came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  We placed our orders and the waitress (who did confess that she typically does the dinner shift) entered my order incorrectly.  She was really sweet and apologetic and left the incorrect dish on the table and said, ""you can pick at that in the meantime while I place the correct order.""  As I reached over to take a piece of vegetable from that plate, the bartender (who was across the room) yells and says, ""Ma'm, excuse me, if you're going to eat that too, you will have to pay for that.""  First off, the waitress just told me 5 seconds ago to eat it and second of all, who does that????  Let's say that it is their policy to take the food back and not have the customer eat it, shouldn't that be something that is quietly discussed with the waitress and not the customer? I was beyond furious at how obnoxious he was being to me and to make matters worse he then began to yell at the poor waitress, who just made an honest mistake.  I am not sure how this douche bag got a job in the service industry but he clearly has no idea how to talk to his customers or the staff.  When I confronted him he told me that he can do whatever he wants, which is funny since this isn't his restaurant.  I wonder how the owner would feel about that.  I guess I will have to email him and find out..."
358881,2013-04-30,921,12892,0,4,"Bijan's is a solid spot in the area, especially after Peter D has kicked you out of his apt for spilling wine on the carpet. The inside is comfortable with a few communal tables, small tables and we actually sat at a table on the elevated stage (great for people watching). The classic burger was excellent. A thick beef mix with plenty of spice, it was juicy enough that ketchup was an after thought. The lime, sumac, rosemary chicken was great as well. A perfect portion of juicy chicken, garlic mashed and some green beans. Def dragging Mr D here for some day drinking and to try more of the menu. I have a feeling I'll upping this rating a star soon."
358882,2013-04-24,921,161095,0,5,"Bijan's is a recent find for me, and I love this little spot.  Bartenders and all the staff are laid back and very friendly. The wood-burning fireplace is a real treat when it's cold outside and adds to the warm, cozy atmosphere. You can't beat the 2 for 1 cocktails during happy hour. The $10 regular price is a deal by NYC standards, and the 2 for 1 special makes them an ultimate bargain.  For a festive feel, I go with the bubbly Persian Kiss.  When in more of a martini mood, I opt for the Bijantini with vodka and ginger (real ginger... nice, fresh and spicy.) On the food side, my experience so far has been limited to the yogurt and herbs and the calamari. Both were excellent. The crowd seems generally chill, and perfectly comfortable for those going solo, couples and small groups.  Enjoy!"
358883,2013-04-22,921,3390,0,3,"This is a great hang out spot with a real fireplace!  Very good music and chilled crowd.  However, I made a lethal mistake by having dinner with 6 other friends here, and their food was bad period.  My seafood soup was purely disgusting.  Again, it was my mistake.  Stick with the appetizers and drinks."
358884,2013-04-10,921,151936,0,4,"I LOVE this spot!  It's become my new favorite little go-to spot in my neighborhood -- kinda thanks to Yelp. I found it cuz I was looking for something away from the standard Smith St stretch ... and it's SO cute and SO charming.  The music's awesome, the food's awesome, the people who work there are awesome.... the ambiance is awesome. Well to be fair, I've only had the lamb burger -- but there's no reason to stray away from that!  And I've mostly stuck to one drink -- something like Pump It Up or something.  At first it was too sweet, but once I told them to keep the spicy and lose the sweet, it was perfect -- spicy goodness. The fireplace made it perfect for the winter...  It's too bad there's no outdoor space, cuz then I could see my whole summer there as well!"
358885,2013-03-10,921,161096,0,4,"Good atmosphere, friendly staff and an eclectic mix of people.  Great place to have a few drinks with some interesting nibbles."
358886,2013-03-05,921,10752,0,5,"Is this the best date restaurant in Brooklyn? I think it might be. It might be too awesome for a first date, though. It's small, but the crowd ebbs and flows throughout the night. It's on a side street, and you'd definitely miss it if you weren't looking for it. The burgers are awesome, the wings are awesome, and everything is priced fairly.  There's a real fireplace; none of this lit fake wood stuff with a little flamerdoodle popping up in the middle...and you can sit a foot away from it without being burned alive. Great drink list, solid list of beers, and interesting layout for such a tiny place. Lots of tables, and even an elevated space for a group of 4-5. Coming To America was on TV without sound when I walked in. That movie is so awesome, it doesn't even need sound and people will still want to watch. Bijan's kind of like that."
358887,2013-03-03,921,3412,0,4,"For a laid back cool cocktail place, this is the spot to come to in Boerum Hill. Decor is awesome and very unique. They also have a great happy hour. Cocktails are usually $10 so you get 2 for the price of 1. Keep in mind, it is two for one per person, so you and a friend can't get one cocktail each for $10 total. Still, a good deal. Beer list is pretty good too. They keep a fire going in the winter, which is nice to sit by on these cold winter days. Their food is good too. A huge plus - they are open late which is not the case for most places in the area for when you get the late night food urge."
358888,2013-03-01,921,5644,0,3,"I love the ambiance at Bijan, especially the wood burning fireplace.  I also like the tables, the bar, and the lighting. Unfortunately, I thought the food was only average, especially when entrees are mostly in the 15-20 range.   I had an enjoyable evening here, but I think next time I would come for cocktails (which are inventive and only 10 dollars) and snacks rather than a dinner.  I had the salmon, and while it was OK, it just wasn't great or worth the 18 dollars I paid for it.   So I would say Bijan is 4 stars for booze but 3 for eating."
358889,2013-02-18,921,3441,0,5,"Great neighborhood bar that's got a great mix of music, decor, and unique cocktails. The friendly staff and laid back atmosphere make you feel like you've been coming there for years, even if it's your first time. The bartenders/waiters really know the drinks inside and out and have always been helpful in finding something that suits my mood. Past reviews have pointed out the happy hour special (2 cocktails for $10), so I'll just second that. One major perk - this is one of the only late-night dining options in the area, especially on the weekend (kitchen open until 2:00 AM!). I ordered the burger for takeout for a late-night dinner and it was pretty legit."
358890,2013-02-12,921,161097,0,5,"Great cocktails friendly bar staff! The food was amazing! Hanger steak  cook perfect med. rare & truffle fries were crispy and flavorful, made from fresh potatoes. My wife had the pork belly special all she said was"" Holy Swine"".  We been there to the bar before for cocktails our bartender was Alex he was great. We only had the  wings OMG they are the best in the city. He made us wild cocktails with ginger and tequila and my wife had pump up the jam. He made us promise to come back for dinner.  It's our new local. Oh I almost forgot we went on Friday during the snow storm and they have a REAL FIREPLACE!!! Yes"
358891,2013-02-11,921,11040,0,4,"I am so happy this place exists. One of the best happy hours in the area with $5 cocktails (strong), great tapas, tasty lamb burger, and delicious vegetable pizza. Good tunes. Real fireplace. Nice mix of people. My only complaint is the service. Really nice waitress but just simply overworked trying to cover the entire bar herself. We had go to the kitchen and ask the chef for ketchup, poured our own water from the pitcher at the waitress stand, and asked the manager at the front for our check. Throw an extra server into the mix, and Bijan looks more like a 5 star establishment."
358892,2013-02-10,921,50421,0,4,"Bijans was delcious. Came here before seeing the Nutcracker at BAM. We took advantage of happy hour (2 fancy cocktails for $10!). The drinks were great. We had the calamari which were crispy and fried beautifully. We also had the smoked eggplant dish which wasn't my fave, but for our entree we split the stake and frittes, it was amazing. Our waitress was lovely and I was very impressed - she was the only one working the small space, but she did a phenomenal job. Def worth a trip!"
358893,2013-02-10,921,42536,0,1,"COCKROACH! There was a baby cockroach crawling out of my friend's water glass, that just made this place go from a 4 star to a 1 star.  Made us all sick to our stomachs and doubt everything we ate...didn't help that one of our friends held up the glass to check it out and it crawled on her hand and she threw it on the ground...guess where the little critter went?  Right into the kitchen!  Ick!"
358894,2013-02-04,921,46319,0,4,"Very cute and quaint bar that plays good muisc.   They serve food here and just from smell alone, it smelled delicious. I'm giving 4 stars based off of the ambiance, music, and bartenders. It was by accident that we visited this place.  We had arrived at Brooklyn Fare's- Chef's Table a little too early and it was freezing out!  One of the ladies that greeted us at Brooklyn Fare's- Chef's table suggested we go hang out at Bijan to stay out of the cold and stay warm.  I'm sooo glad she did!   The artwork here is great  and reminds me of that of Jean-Michel Basquiat pieces and after talking to the bartender, he had mentioned that the artist was another bartender there.   The bartenders were very nice and attentive."
358895,2013-01-24,921,27821,0,2,the happy hour drink selection is NOT for me. both prosecco drinks are way to sweet.  The other drinks are very strong and looked bad too. The eggplant appetizer didn't taste good. the bread that came with it to dip is very hard. Calamari was good. Nice flavor as well. But overall I didn't like the place and left early.
358896,2013-01-24,921,34185,0,4,"Went to Bijan's last week with my girlfriend. She was busy so it was up to me to decide on a place we had not been to for drinks and food. Found this place and the reviews got me excited. Our experience was great. This little but cozy (and nicely decorated) place provided some great service, very creative drinks and some really good food. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was packed when it became time to leave. The ambiance is nice, bar looks very organized and has a good warm character. The combination of small and long wood tables provided a good balance of comfort while maximizing space in a small venue. For drinks we had the: * Persian Kiss: very good but the pomegranate was a bit too overpowering. * Pump up the jam: great drink. The cayenne has a kick that hit you after a few seconds. * A gin, cucumber and lime drink that I cant remember the name, but will crave it for the hot summer days. So refreshing and light but with that subtle gin taste. You can also order it with Vodka. Food was the highlight of the evening. We had the Pistachio Crusted Salmon and the Hanger Steak Frites. Both where fresh, perfectly cooked and tasty as hell. The salmon felt fesh and soft. The truffle mash and vegetables where appropriate and tender. The steak and frites where incredible. As an avid addict of pommel frites, I was amazed when my girlfriend said those where ""the best fries, I've ever had."" I still think Pomme Frites on St. Marks are still king, but the herb fries from Bijan's are well seasoned, perfectly crispy and lots of them! The steak itself was cooked to a perfect medium term and the meat was tender and seasoned lightly. I could taste the quality of the meat instead of an excess of saltiness. We will come again. This place has the charm and friendly staff that we like. There are still many menu items we wanted to try, so Bijan's will surely get a second visit from us."
358897,2013-01-13,921,7295,0,4,"I've walked past this place far too many times, and finally stopped by for after dinner cocktails. The decor is really cozy, and I'm pretty sure my mouth watered when I smelled truffle oil french fries (and to think, I JUST finished dinner). We sat by the bar and I had a jalapeno magarita on the rocks, and it was phenomenal. I followed that with a vodka soda, also lovely. Must come back for food!!"
358898,2013-01-03,921,25208,0,4,"I've been to this place a few times. Last time I was here I got the onion soup. I thought it was going to have cheese and when I said this they gave me some cheese. They have cucumber flavored water, it was interesting. The ambiance in this place was pretty cool and dark. But it definitely is nice quaint place for a drink."
358899,2012-12-30,921,79942,0,3,"We found this place charming, but were a little frustrated by the quality of what we were served. The much-vaunted ""medicinal"" cocktails seemed to have been replaced by ""craft"" cocktails with the same names, but without all the relevant herbs and entertaining health claims. (My Frisky Whiskey, for example, mentioned neither maca nor its alleged libido-enhancing qualities--just as well, probably--but did have some too-sweet ginger liqueur thrown into the mix). If the cucumber salad had pomegranate vinaigrette on it, it was undetectable, and the promised pomegranate in the salad itself  had been replaced with dried cranberries. My boyfriend's chicken breast was actually a chicken thigh, which was just as well because it was very dry and overcooked. My salmon was a bit overcooked as well. None of the little changes in our dishes was mentioned by the waitress before we received the food. This probably sounds like a worse review than I intend it to be, though. The flavors and sauces in everything were good, but the execution was off. Looking around, we noticed that the mostly young crowd were eating mostly small plates. We're guessing/hoping that if we stay away from the entrees and stick with smaller dishes next time we'll probably be better off."
358900,2012-12-28,921,161098,0,4,"It wasn't too promising of a start with three menu items not available despite not being particularly busy. But the martinis were tasty and the appetizers and food excellent as well. We had the Persian wings and a yogurt and cucumber dip for the flatbread. Then seafood stew to finish off. The chef apologized for how long it took, but we had not even noticed. The ambience is not fancy, but the food and drink and service well worth a visit."
358901,2012-12-01,921,73031,0,3,"We stopped in for Saturday brunch while walking by and I'm glad I did! They were out of the lamb burger so I opted for the short rib burger instead. AMAZING! They nailed medium-rare when 5-star restaurants don't get it right! The omelets are more like frittatas and can lean towards the over-cooked side. A $15 prix fix brunch comes with a ""medicinal"" cocktail , coffee and entree. The cocktails are HELLA GOOD and strong. The coffee is curiously delicious that reminded me of what I had in Paris. UPDATE- I've been here for lunch a few times and I have to remove a star for slow service. To their defense, there seems to be only one waitress for lunch service and she tends the bar too."
358902,2012-11-23,921,6762,0,5,"Bijan's may be the coziest tippling hole in the neighborhood with friendly bartenders, well-mixed refreshing cocktails, and a menu of shareable eats that will hold it all down.  There's something so easy and familiar about this place, it'll make you want to stay for hours chatting with your friends.  Groups will find the long picnic tables in the middle convenient, but don't be so loud that you disturb others in this small space.  As a final note, love that it's close to transportation, unlike our other fave happy hour spots on the western end of Atlantic."
358903,2012-11-18,921,161099,0,5,"Kitschy-charming interior, stiff drinks, impeccable food. I was particularly moved by my chicken entree. Chicken, well, is chicken - but here, it is much, much more."

358905,2012-10-16,921,25765,0,5,"I've only sampled some of the food, and I've only been to this place on weekdays before 8pm, so... limited experience.... but I can comfortably say this place overall is at least a 4 star establishment. ""Then why the extra star Jake?"" Good question you! The fifth star is for the happy hour... This place has above average to well-above average cocktails, and at $10 a piece, one might even say they're 'reasonably priced' in this mixed up world where $10 for a cocktail at the nexus of downtown brooklyn, cobble hill, and ft. greene (?) counts as 'reasonable'. BUT during happy hour (before 7pm) they're 2 for 1.... so quick math... carry the 2.... $5 cocktails! Additionally, the ambiance is pleasant, the wings were pretty great, and the staff is exceedingly friendly... like friendly to the point where you can order 4 happy hour cocktails for 2 people between 6:55 and 7:05 and they won't bat an eyelash (yes. that IS an expression) or call you cheap (at least not to your face!!)."
358906,2012-10-07,921,161101,0,4,Great chicken wings: Persian spiced wings! Casual atmosphere in a great Brooklyn neighborhood.

358908,2012-09-30,921,18011,0,4,"This review is only for their Happy Hour.  2 for 1 cocktails!  Now, I'm not a fan of cocktails usually because they tend to be too sweet for my taste.  But their ""medicinal"" cocktails have a wide variety of options, including several non-sweet ones.  My standout was the pepperonici martini.  It's basically a dirty martini but with pepperonici juice instead!  My friend got a couple of sweet ones which she thoroughly enjoyed.   Foodwise, the wings were recommended and pretty tasty.  I love buffalo wings and tend to be hesitant to order other types, but the Persian wings had really great flavor.  I would probably order them again.  The heirloom tomato salad was really fresh, and we also enjoyed the yogurt/herb mezze with their flatbread.   Started to get busy later on in the evening, but not too crowded even on a Friday night.  Definitely will be going there again after work for another Happy Hour."
358909,2012-09-14,921,161103,0,5,"Bijan's you came and you gave me cheap drinks of my vacation from workee!   My wife and I recently stumbled upon Bijan's while waiting to get into our friend's apartment where we were staying on our recent trip to Brooklyn.  We were tired and grumpy, having been locked out with all our luggage.   The cure were half-price medicinal drinks, tasty appies and warm, friendly service.  The drinks were fantastic.  My wife had the one with cayenne pepper and I had the Gin drink.  Both were excellent.  We had the olives and eggplant walnut dip, which was the perfect pre-dinner snack.  I loved the decor, music and vibe - chill, cool, and relaxed. Definitely recommend!"
358910,2012-09-08,921,161104,0,4,"okay. i won't let the fact that i was hired to work here as a server then never got a shift deter me from writing an objective review. it's a really sweet restaurant. in a really tuh-RIFF neighborhood. that said... let's start with their specialty, which are cocktails. and not just any kinda' cocktail, but herb infused, physiologically balanced concoctions. yes! that's right, folks, drinks,that are mixologically created to restore you to a better you. i mean, that's what alcohol intends to do, but their drinks are especially designed to make you feel fan-TAS-tic. with ingredients like ""immune building elderflower"", ""antioxidating pomegranate nectar"", ""healing mint"" and don't even start me on the ""libido enhancing maca"", there is no way you are leaving this bar in a bad mood. i don't know what the #@!* maca is, but anything libido enhancing is divine in my book. aaaaaaand all for the extremely reasonable price of $10 a drink ~ what?!?! then there's the issue of timing. you'd think a drink with those kinda' ingredients would take awhile to land in front of you seeing as how the bartender has to grab the ingredients from the garden out back, but, nooooooo. they arrive lickety-split. especially if you're at the bar. cheap and quick ~ sounds like my ex! now onto the food. hmm...you know, i'm going to have to get back to you on this. when i was in training, for one day, it all sounded really delish ~ pistachio crusted salmon, lamb burger with sweet potato fries, persian spiced chicken wings ~ but i never got the chance to dine on their FAAAB-u-lous fare so i'm going to have to get back to you on this one. in the meantime, get down to bijans in the heart of boreum hill and find out just how fantastic they are for yourself!"
358911,2012-08-31,921,47368,0,5,"Great space, loved the modern/artsy feel of it--not just typical ""brooklyn"" which was really refreshing. Enjoyed my drink and the jazz on Sunday nights. Service was also great."
358912,2012-08-18,921,73489,0,4,"This place is really cute.  Went there on a Friday night with 3 people - really easy to get a table.  The ambience is eclectic, casual, comfortable. What We Ordered: - Wings - really dang good - lots of flavor and mildly spicy - Grill bread - definitely a skip next time - the bread itself was just sort of there (needed to rise more and be crispier) - Lemon Rosemary Chicken - this was amazing, great presentation and really tasty - just as good as a really nice restaurant.  Chicken was moderately sized which I appreciated having a few apps and not wanting to be overfull. - Drinks - I had 3 Red Hot Pumps and they were really tasty and quite strong (I was very tipsy after 3 of them!) - Complimentary Chips - these were surprisingly good, homemade, very peppery. Definitely coming back here!"
358913,2012-07-28,921,22109,0,4,"300th review, ladies and gentlemen... here it is: I came with a small group for dinner, which we were immediately seated for. They brought out some crispy homemade potato chips. For dinner, we had an assortment of entrees. I had the salmon with a pistachio crust and truffle mashed potatoes. Also at the table was a steak, pulled pork sandwich, and roasted chicken. All were delicious, but I can mostly speak for the salmon. Our server was really sweet and said that people came from out of town just to have the salmon. I'm not sure that I would, but it was definitely tasty. Service was wonderful, and although we did not order small plates it seems like a place where you could go and have a few meze shared between a group."
358914,2012-07-22,921,45534,0,5,Drinks are amazing! Had the pickletini and the MILF and thoroughly enjoyed them. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Very easy to get a drink unlike some bars that you have to wait for the bartender to look at you. We may have found a regular spot. Nice and quiet atmosphere for a Saturday night.
358915,2012-07-17,921,132382,0,5,"This place is unbelievable. Great drinks, great atmosphere, very friendly staff, INCREDIBLE chicken wings, and the bill?? So good we thought there was a mistake. I'm so happy there are still places like this in Brooklyn. Though maybe, after all the reviews, this too shall pass..."
358916,2012-07-16,921,18580,0,2,"Disclaimer: I have mixed feelings about how to write this review because the group I was with experienced a lot of issues this past Sunday during brunch but the owner was so sweet and attentive to us. BUT - I'm going to have to keep it real. I'm sorry Bijan's! Review: I arrived at Bijan's around 2:30pm and there was only 2 other people in the entire restaurant. I guess their Sunday brunch is not very popular but I can see why. I asked the waitress for what plates were popular or which plates she would suggest I try. She was very unenthusiastic about helping me which made me slightly annoyed and skeptical about how I would enjoy my meal. I decided to order the steak and eggs with a mimosa ($15 all inclusive brunch). As I sat sipping and waiting for the food to come out I realized how uncomfortably warm I was. The AC needed to be on full blast but it wasn't. My legs were sweating and sticking to the chair and I kept trying to fan myself. My friend agreed that it was very warm in there as well. I was not a happy camper. Finally the food came out, very slowly - one plate a time slowly. As soon as the waitress placed the food on the table my reaction was ""Is this all?"" The portions were so meager! For that long of a wait, you'd think the staff in the back was cooking up a storm. If I thought the portions were small than I could only imagine what the other five men in our group thought. Again, I was not a happy camper. My disappointment continued when I had to keep shooing a fly away while I was eating. I also was near half done with my meal when the home fries arrived. It was supposed to be served together with the dish. I wasn't really sure what the hold up was considering we were the only people in the entire restaurant ordering food. On top of that, a couple of people's orders came out incorrectly. Eggs with no cheese, missing home fries, etc. The waitress looked slightly embarrassed and kept saying ""We can do the eggs over for you."" SMH. I don't know if it was just a bad day in the kitchen, but the way the chef allowed the food to leave the kitchen was unacceptable- like he didn't give a shit about what he was doing or who he was serving. Even the owner had to go in the back and reprimand the kitchen staff about how to prepare the meal! [2]  How hard is it to make steak and eggs or pancakes?! I ate my meal and tried to enjoy it as best as I can. The home fries were dry but still relatively flavorful. I wondered if it was freshly made or warmed up in the microwave though. Also I ordered scrambled eggs but it came out in the shape of an omelet (again, failing to execute an order correctly). The steak was pretty good, although cut it small pieces, it seemed like the meal was prepared for a little kid (I can cut my own meat). Mimosa was decent although there was some pulp from the orange juice. Overall, I would say based on the meal and service alone I would not come back here. I really wanted to love this place, especially considering its reviews. HOWEVER, and this is a big HOWEVER, this restaurant is black owned and I love to see my fellow people doing their thing! I am going to give this place another try- Especially since the owner was so kind to us and talked us up while we were there. [3] The decor is pretty fly as well and I definitely can see why this place would be great to come after work and sip and chat with a few buddies. This place has SO MUCH potential but would do better if it were staffed with employees who are more friendly/upbeat and with a kitchen staff who is concerned about the quality and presentation of the food they serve. ______________________________ [1] After we ate, a few of us went to the corner store to order a sandwich, which in my opinion, they seemed to enjoy more than brunch. [2] Unfortunately we were sitting near the kitchen and heard the whole thing. It was just very uncomfortable. [3] I'd come back only for the drinks as the food was a disappointment."
358917,2012-07-16,921,93583,0,4,"The first time we came to Bijan's was to have a drink while we waited for a table for dinner at a place nearby.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice bartender.  My buddy and I chose to have a beer from their decent list of seasonal draft beers.  Our dates wanted to try one of the unique cocktails that they offer.  Most had an ingredient they weren't sure about and the bartender kindly explained what the ingredient was and what its purpose was for the concoction.  He also said if they didn't see anything they wanted on the menu that they could tell him what they were in the mood for and what they typically like in a drink and he would make them something that wasn't on the menu.  Of course they opted for a custom cocktail.  Both loved what he whipped up for them.   Since then we have gone back several times.  It is much more crowded  than it was then.  And they have also started to serve food (not sure when that started, just know they didn't do it in the beginning).  However we have always still had the same great service we received on our first visit."
358918,2012-07-08,921,3370,0,5,Fantastic staff and delicious cocktails. The bartender crafted a drink based on my physical and mental state. (New parent. Very Tired.) it was perfect. Love this place.
358919,2012-07-01,921,121394,0,2,"Hubby and I headed here for brunch after reading all the great reviews. The vibe was mellow and comfortable. The menu was limited, but with enough variety. Unfortunately the burger was thin (think BK patty) and overcooked. The chicken salad sammy was nothing special. Salad greens weren't dressed; I felt like a rabbit eating grass. I like the feel of the place enough that I might try this place again - maybe it was just a meh kind of day."
358920,2012-06-23,921,1109,0,3,"Popped in for Happy Hour, on a hot and stormy Friday afternoon.  Love the 2 for 1 on cocktails (2 for $10).  With names like ""Pump up the Jams"" and ""Gin-X,"" you can't help but try a few with those prices. I had both previously mentioned. More spice than whiskey in the first, but still liked it. The ""Gin-X"" was a perfect mix of gin and basil. I'll be back for more of those."
358921,2012-06-15,921,12783,0,3,"I think Bijan is hit or miss. I see the potential, but I didn't get the same experience as others. The server, who did admit that she was new, was unable to answer many questions. The Persian-spiced chicken wings (fried, sweet, sticky and spicy) were finger-licking good. The mashed potatoes (rustic) and haricots verts (delicious, but not enough) that came with the pistachio-crusted salmon (dry, didn't taste that fresh, under-seasoned and there was no ""crust"") were divine. The classic burger (1/2 short ribs and 1/2 ground chuck) came extremely overcooked for medium; it was dry and we just didn't like the taste. The home-cooked potato chips were good. On the plus side, nothing was overly salted. The space is thisbig, but extremely cute with a fireplace, chaise lounge and branches that serve as ceiling fixtures."
358922,2012-06-08,921,2230,0,5,"The cat's out of the bag! Bijan's is no longer my lil' secret. The second time I went, it was packed! This was during after work hours, let's say around 7pm on a Thursday. My coworkers and I were lucky enough to pull together a few tables and own the back section of the place. The cocktails on the menu will run you $10. Trust me when I say this is a good deal. The bartenders here are NOT shy with their pour. I had one milf for the night and I considered myself pretty tipsy and I did not order any food at the time. My third visit, I cam here with my brother. We ordered a LOT of food. The wings, flat bread pizza and calamari. The wings were perfect. Juicy, crunchy, spicy. The blue cheese dip could be its own dish, seriously good. I was very impressed. Look... Get the food, have a drink, enjoy my spot. You're welcome!"
358923,2012-06-08,921,161105,0,5,Loved the decor and drinks were well priced!
358924,2012-06-06,921,161106,0,4,"I went here one night w/ my boyfriend. Loved it!! The staff is awesomely friendly, the food delicious and the drinks exoctic and yummy that sneak up on you. I loved the music selection and the mixed matched decor. The only thing I didn't like was the Happy Hour ended and they didn't warn us so the bill was more than we expected. Other than that of course I'll keep going back for more."
358925,2012-06-01,921,30828,0,5,"Really Cynthia D? The thing that stood out that was odd was the size of the menu? If you want unlimited options i would suggest a diner. There you will find numbers next to the entrees to make it easier. This place has everything you want in your local bar restaurant. Incredibly well thought out food with a persian twist, , great cocktails and a solid beer selection. A classic.  Larry is a world class mixologist just tell him what u like."
358926,2012-05-27,921,161107,0,4,"I would highly recommend this restaurant.  The food selection was simple, yet all the items on the menu was flavorful.  It was the perfect setting for a date.  It was quiet and laid back.  For an appetizer we had the persian spiced chicken wings and the white goat cheese flat bread.  We should have order only one, since the portions were so large.  For the entree we had the lime, sumac, rosemary chicken breast and the hanger steak frites.  I must admit the steak was juicy, tender and seasoned to perfection and the chicken breast meal was absolutely delicious.  The reason I rated them a four instead of a five is because of the limited menu.  However, overall a great experience, I am glad I gave this small place a try."
358927,2012-05-24,921,69631,0,5,"This is a great place - I found it almost by accident as I was browsing Yelp reviews in the area, but once I stopped in for the first time (Persian chicken wings - you must try them!) I knew I'd come back.  And come back I did (wings again!), and again (cucumber salad!), and again (what WAS that cocktail that Larry mixed?), and again (pappardelle - oh my!), and again. Great staff, great atmosphere. Come for the food, stay for the drinks.  Or come for the drinks, stay for the food.  Either way, you should invite your friends, too."
358928,2012-05-10,921,161108,0,3,"I feel kinda bad about giving a low score given that I can tell that quite a few people really love this place. The atmosphere was okay. The place itself is a cozy space and has some interesting artwork. The problem was that we were there for dinner and were expecting good food given the high yelp rating. The menu didn't have many items to choose from. My friend got the salmon after asking if the portion was good sized and being assured that it was.  What came was a very small strip of salmon that was very bland. I ordered calamari and it tasted like it may have been breaded and frozen for awhile. The sauce it came with didn't have much taste. Our drinks were good but the food was only mediocre. The music was loud for a restaurant, okay for a bar. Personally, I don't need to hear Pearl Jam blasting while I eat. Maybe come here for drinks if you live in the neighborhood, but if you are hungry go someplace else."
358929,2012-05-04,921,7220,0,4,"As stop number three for a lovely Brooklyn adventure, this was a lucky find. And thanks to yelpers for pointing me to it! Walking through Cobble hill and then crossing Atlantic, we stumble upon Bijan's after a nice twenty minute stroll through the hills.  This block of Hoyt Street is interesting.  Lots of commuters walking home from a long day of work, some bicyclists as there's a bike lane that runs this way too. We step into the space, and the first thing we both notice is all the wood.  There's a wood wreath behind the bar, and a large circular wooden wreath mounted on the ceiling.  Not a xmas type of wreath, but a huge pagan one that seems to be made out of driftwood.  An interesting vibe.  The space is sooo calming and chill.  A bunch of people are relaxing at the bar, and we find ourselves a table to relax at. I order a Bijan and my Brooklyn loving hipster from bside goes for the Persian Kiss.  Prosecco being a hit with her, I'm not surprised she loves it.  The cocktail in my hands has a leaf of mint in it, to remind me that it's a healthy concoction of vodka - we all know it's medicinal qualities, pineapple, immune building elderflower and ball-busting cayenne.  Amen to the healing properties.  A doctor friend of mine would approve I'm sure!"
358930,2012-05-02,921,29336,0,5,"Me: ""OMG, they have a fireplace...with REAL wood!"" Sean: ""Uh, yeah...I can see that."" I don't normally frequent places that have fireplaces with real firewood. So whenever I see one, it's like someone from the west coast seeing snow for the first time. They also have a huge wooden bench in the middle of the bar. Come to think of it, the place was decked out with wood. We came after dinner around 9ish...or was it 10? There were people gathered at the bar...but we decided to sit on a tall table with stools instead. I looked around and the white lounge chair on the elevated stage by the window caught my eyes. We moved our seats...and people watched until we finished our drinks. Speaking of drinks, they have unique names for their cocktails. I got something called the Persian Kiss, and it looked like apple cider. It had Prosecco and pomegranate juice -- SO GOOD. He had something called the Bijan, and I just remember it being awesome and having some sort of spice and cucumbers, kinda looked like eggnog. The place and atmosphere is very friendly. They even let a couple of bike riders park their bikes by the fireplace. I instantly fell in love with Bijan when they started playing 50's music. The Supremes, The Temptations...WHAT! We didn't have a chance to check out the food menu but I'd love to come back for it."
358931,2012-04-24,921,99762,0,5,"Update:  Bijan's came on the scene as a great local hangout, complete with revolving art displays (open until 4 am) and has since opened their kitchen, serving a range of plates that have a subtle Persian twist.  The Steak and truffle fries are really great, as is the cucumber salad with feta!  And the growing bar staff is great!  A true neighborhood hangout."
358932,2012-04-16,921,79895,0,5,"I've been wanting to go here for months now, and finally went! The experience was just as I expected, but more! The drinks were delicious! The mojitos hit the spot, and there's an interesting Whiskey drink with ginger or cinammon that had a great kick to it. Great cocktail choices. The drinks were around 10 dollars each. The waitress, Erica, was a lot of help and very sweet. The ambiance is very relaxing and chill. Enjoyed the music as well. They serve food as well, but didn't get a chance to try any. Will be back again... probably this week!"
358933,2012-02-19,921,28341,0,4,"My friend and I ended up at this bar/lounge after dinner and after doing a quick Google Map search, we walked over even though we passed this place twice. Everyone was seated at the bar whereas my friend and I decided to take up space at the communal table.  Their selection of beer is mostly organic beer along with some Belgian ales. My friend opted for the Belgian Ale but I had to refrain from drinking that night because I had a cold and was on antibiotics. Overall, I liked the vibe of the place.  The crowd was definitely more in their late 20s - 30s so it was civilized.  There weren't people spilling drinks on me and we didn't have to shout over to be heard. I truly loved the music and whomever picked the playlist that night was AWESOME! A lot of the music was downtempo and surprisingly I owned a couple of their compilations.  I definitely heard some Nordic Lounge and gave me some sweet, sweet dreams that night. It's chill and laid back and the designer definitely had some good taste.  There's a fireplace to the side with red candles lit inside to give it this nice ambience and along the far left situated against the windows is a modern, sleek  two seater couch. There's some contemporary artwork that adorn the walls as well. I'd definitely come back for a few more drinks for the music, the ambience and of course their selection of beers were appetizing!"
358934,2012-02-18,921,27822,0,5,"After living in Boerum Hill for nearly three years, I can honestly say I've never been so impressed with an opening of a new bar (and soon to be restaurant, yay!). Bijan's has everything I'm looking for in a bar, including original and chic decor, great music (ranging from down tempo to house and even some retro), normal priced drinks and an awesome staff who are so cool you want to be their friend. My favorite part of Bijan's is the white leather couch / bench / bed that stands on an elevated platform near the back. It's so comfortable and fun to lie on. You feel like you're about to get a psychotherapy session. I'm so glad Bijan's is only a few blocks away from me. I'm afraid it won't be long until this hidden gem becomes a popular place for locals and Brooklynites from all over."
358935,2012-01-25,921,3504,0,5,"Ever since Bijan's opened up, happy days are here again. Literally: one time I walked in and Happy Days was playing on the TV. Fonzie aside, I'm so happy Bijan's is here. It's about a block away from me, and I can't imagine a better bar to have in the 'hood. The vibe is intimate, but casual. The music is always good, which makes it the perfect place to kick off your night with a quiet drink. As the hour gets later, the soul/funk gives way to more danceable tunes, so it's also a much better late-night spot than my apartment. And I'm definitely not just saying that because your drunk ass spilled wine on my carpet last time. It can get a little packed in the small space, but the service is always friendly and the drinks are always good. Larry seems to be behind the bar more often than not, and this is a good thing. He's one of the friendliest, funniest guys around, and spot on with his mixing of the medicinal cocktails on the menu. I love that each drink description tells you the therapeutic benefits of that pumpkin, mint, chili pepper, etc. It makes me feel that much better about having five of them in a sitting. Good music, good drinks, good vibe...I'm already in danger of spending entirely too much time here. And to top it off, the kitchen is opening in early February...at which point I won't even have to leave to go eat things so I can come back and drink more. Better get used to it, Larry, you're gonna see way more of me than anyone really wants to."
358936,2012-01-18,921,45596,0,5,"This is my new favorite neighborhood bar.  I was wondering what was going to open there, because the last place was loud and a little obnoxious, but this place is awesome: understated, welcoming, friendly.  I've met two bartenders, Larry and Meghan, and they both made fantastic off-the-menu drinks with little helpful guidance from me about what I wanted.  The fireplace also makes it a great spot for drinks on cold winter nights, and it's quiet enough to have a conversation with friends."
358937,2012-01-06,921,161109,0,5,"We were there for their New Year's Eve party and had a great time. The crowd was fun and lively, the food was yummy and the drinks were delicious.  They brought in some live entertainment -- two DJs and some fire-eaters -- which ensured that we spent most of the night boogying. The fireplace and overall decor make Bijan feel very homey. Larry and Meagan, both of whom tended bar that night, were awesome! We had a blast and can't wait to return."
358938,2012-01-02,921,161110,0,5,Wonderful little bar with good people and atmosphere
358939,2011-12-02,921,101544,0,4,"The place used to be so dodgy (which had its own charm, I must confess), that it was the better version of Cokie's in W'burg, namely in terms of scoring that implied substance. But what a transformation! For the better, for sure. Smart, creative drinks and even smarter and more creative bartenders. I like the organic, week-by-week evolution of the place as well. Although I will lament the day food is introduced, because I will no longer be able to bring in the doggie! He likes Bijan's too."
358940,2011-11-09,921,27585,0,5,awesome awesome awesome.  Have been waiting for this place to open up and the wait was totally worth it. My two fave things about Bijan's:  It's just a short walk from my place (I am very lazy) and Larry the bartender is amazing. He makes great cocktails and is hilarious. Like everyone else....I'm hoping it doesn't get TOO busy in here bc I already called dibs on my seat at the bar.  So gimme some room. Food is coming and other events like open mic nights.  Definitely worth checking out.
358941,2011-11-08,921,15088,0,5,"Bijan is a work in progress, like this review was for the last two weeks. The kitchen was not opened yet, but the regulars and drinks are taking formation. A fireplace and a great elevated couch decorate the entranceway. Dee, this remodeled venue is just craving for more fun times and stories to be had."
358942,2011-10-27,921,99820,0,5,"I saw this bar had opened a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to try it out.  Turns out, this place is a fabulous new spot.  I went there on a Saturday night.  The bar was not very crowded, which meant my friend and I had plenty of room to sit and it wasn't too noisy.  The bartender convinced me to try out one of the signature cocktails, which was so good I ended up having two of them.  He was great, very friendly and knowledgeable. I will definitely be coming back here again."
358943,2011-10-15,921,45617,0,5,"I found this bar after being so sick of the awful music at flying saucer that I needed to find a new place to get some work done on my laptop.   So, imagine my surprise when I came across a new bar that opened up a block away from my house.  Further, it's not only low-key with a tasteful ambiance, but also with wifi and a friendly owner.   From what I gather, the kitchen is about to open and will serve tapas.  I hesitate to give away what's going to be my new haunt, but this place is so much better than anything else I've found in Boerum Hill that the owner deserves the foot traffic."
358944,2014-03-25,349,161111,1,1,"First and last time we try this place.  Pizza crust was hard as a rock (also took too long to arrive). My boyfriend and I ordered the Arugula salads to start with. Our suggestion: DON'T ORDER SALAD FROM THIS PLACE unless you like a bland, tasteless salad. Back to the pizza...The sausage on our Camp Randall pizza smelled disease-ridden and I felt like puking after two bites.  I've not had a worse tasting meal in a long time.  How can they serve stuff like this?   There aren't many restaurant options in this area, which makes Emily an easy pick for the neighborhood..but I would highly recommend making the trek to go somewhere else instead of wasting your time on this self proclaimed loveable pizza.  It was horrific.  I will never go there again. Maybe management needs to re-evaluate the quality of their products that they offer. Sorry Emily ...Thumbs down."
358945,2014-04-09,349,161112,1,3,"The staff was incredibly nice, the lemonade tasty and the salads crunchy and flavorful. BUT The sauce was not flavorful at all and tasted like canned tomatoes.  The cheese was sparse and the pizza left us feeling unusually thirsty afterwards.  The crust was good, but had a bit of a burnt taste to it. I think with a few kinks ironed out and a stronger sauce recipe this place could be a contender."
358946,2014-12-05,349,74347,1,5,"Emily's inspired me to start a yelp account!  I love this place!  Food, especially pizza is so good!  The ambiance is great. I've lived down the block from here for the past 10 years and i can't tell you how happy i am that Emily's is here!  Clearly i would recommend this place!"
358947,2015-01-06,349,161113,0,5,"I love having this place in the neighborhood. Usually I go on a week night and sit at the bar. Everyone working is friendly and accommodating. I'm not generally a fan of fancy pizza, but Emily seems to do it just right. My favorites are the The Wrestler and The Emily. They have a good beer selection and wine on tap. Also, try the s'mores calzone for dessert. Yum!   This place is a keeper :)"
358948,2015-01-04,349,92236,0,1,"Never even got to try the food. At 3 PM on a saturday, with only one table occupied, we were stopped as soon as we stepped foot inside. We were not allowed since we had a stroller with child. In a supposedly family friendly neighborhood, we were turned away. Strange and unpleasant. Obvisouly won't try to go again."
358949,2015-01-01,349,161114,0,5,Really fantastic pizza and even better customer service. Big nod to the vodka sauce pizzas-- they are even better cold a few hours later.
358950,2014-12-15,349,161115,0,3,"Okay, so I gotta repeat the chorus here and state that the food is indeed, superb and some of the best pizza out there. Smoky carrots are top notch, the Emily (a honey and truffle-pistachio mix), the Vodka (a margherita style pizza but with a solid vodka sauce) and the PXG (a salsa verde-sausage pizza) are without a doubt, creative and perfectly crafted wood-fired slices of heaven. However, the service is quite spotty and the sound levels are horrid. It's an incredibly hectic place to eat, let alone carry a conversation in. If you can withstand those bad elements, and the occasionally long wait times for a table, you'll definitely be rewarded with the food which is nothing short of excellent."
358951,2014-12-15,349,128817,0,5,"Best pizza around, period. Really good other food and amazing drinks. I'm a little carb-conscious, or I'd be there every day."
358952,2014-12-14,349,25025,0,2,"Here's how you lose 3 stars solely because of poor service. And by the owner, Emily Hyland, no less.   Last night, after a 45-minute wait, my boyfriend and I were seated at the bar. Fine, however, when we noticed not one, but two open two-seater tables, we asked the hostess if she wouldn't mind if we switched to a table. Uh oh, what ensued was nothing short of a passive-aggro fit, in which the hostess told us that a party of four was waiting for the table. The two-seater table in question was on the far end of the restaurant, next to just one other two-seater table, occupied by a couple who had just arrived. So if this was a space meant for 4 people, they'd have to wait another hour at least. Anyway, not even 5 minutes after we were seated -- and after the hostess once again reprimanded us for asking for a table, said party of 4 was seated at a table for -- you guessed it -- FOUR. We decided to fuggetaboutit and enjoy our night, BUT not before the hostess goes ""The next time you come to dinner here, you should specify that you prefer a table over a bar seat BEFORE I put your name on the wait list."" After dinner, the hostess returned to apologize to my boyfriend and tell him that she was in fact, the OWNER of Emily. Wait. It gets better. As we're eating dessert, she returns to give us two free glasses of champagne -- nice -- AND to inform us once more that she is the owner of Emily. I thought she might pull up a 3rd chair to sit and tell us yet again that she's the owner. Here's a tip: Treat your patrons with respect, and then you won't have to resort to freebies and phony small talk. Or better yet, hire an experienced hostess. All that said, the food was incredibly perfect. From the radishes in butter to the smoky carrots to the cavatelli -- and then finally, The Colony Pizza. But I just can't imagine eating there ever again -- or recommending it to friends for that matter. Thanks, Emily: The Owner."
358953,2014-12-11,349,103977,0,5,"as discussed elsewhere, the food here is really amazing.  special props to the RM3 and the Emily.  note that you should avoid the green pizzas if you don't like spicy food. i'm mostly writing this review because i wanted to specially note that the staff here is among the friendliest & most helpful i have ever experienced in brooklyn. mad ups."
358954,2014-12-10,349,161116,0,2,"The pizza is delicious, but it's SO loud here, and not particularly friendly/welcoming - I can have a nicer experience across the street, or just get pizza to go if I really want a pie. There are other places to go if I want a great pizza and a nice meal out, I just need to walk a few more blocks. This is the place to go if you're in your 20s and want to impress a date with your ""coolness"" but otherwise not worth the trouble."
358955,2014-12-09,349,161117,0,5,"I almost don't want to write this review so I can have Emily all to myself! It's my happy place. Food: The Colony (red sauce, cheese, pepperoni, pickled chili's and honey) is AMAZING. I could easily eat this everyday. Their other pies are good too, but it's hard not to just get the colony every time. My bf and I get a pizza and then something else (app, pasta, etc) every time and it's a perfect meal. There pastas are great too, they frequently change em up so be sure to check them out. Drinks: Great. Love the goodybags... Some kind of amaretto, bourbon and egg white concoction that is just right. Atmosphere: Perfection. On a Friday night expect to hear our neighborhood boy Biggie and the like. Some nights is indie, equally great. Staff: Totally awesome, everyone's really friendly. Overall: I'm happy to go every weekend and unwind with great food, drinks, music and awesome staff. It's a perfect way to end the hectic work week."
358956,2014-11-24,349,46272,0,5,"Great pizza addition to the neighborhood.  This was my second time here and it was just as good as the first time I tried it when it first opened.  Consistency is key.  This place is small, so be prepared to wait if you come during peak time. We arrived at 6 on a Sunday and were able to snag a seat at the bar, but even the bar seats filled up within 10 minutes of us sitting down.  Nice wine selection, and there is a large range  of bottle prices, but it would be nice  if they had more than 2 glass options for whites and 2 glass options for reds.  The sweet potato and sausage appetizer  was excellent.  So much flavor and spice and the cilantro complimented it well.  I had the duck ragu during my first visit, and that was also excellent. You cant go wrong with any pizza, we had the colony and it had the perfect balance of hot with the chilies and sweet with the honey. I am looking forward to trying some of the other pizzas, there are quite a few to choose from."
358957,2014-11-21,349,161118,0,2,"This is a decent spot for takeout when they're not too busy, in which case they have no problem turning you away. Service is not so great though (short girl with tattoos and piercings comes to mind especially). No one is really that friendly and they will absolutely criticize or reject your requests. One time I asked for sausage to be added to my cavatelli entree (which is an option for their pizza for $3) and was flat out denied because the chef did not approve of the pairing (jeez). It probably goes without saying if you live in the neighborhood, but definitely go to Barboncino or Speedy Romeo's instead of you have the opportunity."
358958,2014-11-19,349,89604,0,5,"I'm tempted not to tell you about this place. It's great.  Some of the best pizza around now.   I'm more of a purist and so am not a fan of their menu - too many concoctions and ingredients - but the pizza is top notch.  Better than Lucali and Franny for sure.  Not Di Fara in its hey day, but nothing is.  This is about as good as it gets, as Yelp says."
358959,2014-11-18,349,41798,0,4,"I love, love, love Emily. The pizza is amazing, among my top 5 in all of NYC, and everything else I've had has been great -- pasta, appetizers, cocktails, the insane burger. It's also really near my house, so has become a go-to spot in the neighborhood. That said...PLEASE TURN DOWN THE MUSIC! It's nearly impossible to carry on a conversation, much less hear the waitress when she describes the specials. It's good music, it's just WAY too loud. (The actual person Emily is great too -- I always hope she's hostessing when we go, it's just not the same without her!)"
358960,2014-11-16,349,23432,0,5,"Went in here on a friends recommendation. Just go here if you like pizza and brunch and think it sounds too good to be true to mesh them together.  Eggs and Bacon pizza was glorious!  Cappuccino was made perfect.  Waitress was wonderful, friendly and attentive!  Can't wait to go back!"
358961,2014-11-16,349,54698,0,5,"This little tiny pizza place was incredible. Our group ordered three pizzas and they were all excellent. For a place that serves brunch and lunch as well, it was surprisingly empty inside. I wish we could have tried more daring pizzas - some of them come with a light drizzle of honey that seems weird as a pizza topping but is surprisingly tasty. Definitely recommend this place!"
358962,2014-11-14,349,70771,0,5,"We usually have lunch here, given the long dinner wait times. The food is simply amazing, I'd place the pizzas almost on par with more well known places such as Roberta's. The new expanded menu offers more varieties, and everything we have tried out has been excellent."
358963,2014-11-11,349,161119,0,2,"I invited my two friends to this place after reading some good reviews and visiting emily's website. The girl at door was really friendly (she actually came to the bar next door to tell us our table is ready) But that was the only good thing. Website describes the pizza as ""new style"". I don't know, maybe if new style means completely burnt pizza then OK. Maybe it's because the place is so dark that the poor pizza guy can't see what's going on with his  pizza. But seriously as european who's been in italy many times (from north to south) I am completely fine with a little burnt edges that's something that comes naturally and is wanted but this pizza (actually three pizzas) were way too burnt and had color and taste of coal. If it hadn't been burnt I believe it could be good. But at the end the pizza slice from those cheap shitty places at every corner was better experience then this new style pancake."
358964,2014-11-04,349,161120,0,5,Love this place so much can't wait to bring my parents to meet her
358965,2014-10-17,349,7310,0,5,"Incredible pizza--not NY-style, more Italian-proper, I think?  Each pie is a little larger than a personal pie, great for sharing.  My table tried four pies and I enjoyed them all, with the most memorable being the ""green"" pizza, which uses tomatillo sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I'm not saying I'd want this to replace regular pizza, I'm just saying I haven't seen it anywhere else before, ordered it thinking it'd be just a kind of curiosity, and ended up loving it. For appetizers, I tried the smoked carrots, which smelled like sausage.  A nice and not-unhealthy small plate. For dessert, the banana pudding is like everything good you ever wanted to put in your mouth and then did and then were happy. Didn't try the pastas nor the cocktails--please ask me to come here with you so I have an excuse to do so. Service was warm and efficient.  The space is small and welcoming--dim, exposed brick, stylish somehow.  Awesome soundtrack--they were incongruously but wonderfully playing psychedelic 60's Cambodian pop the entire time I was there."
358966,2014-10-13,349,161121,0,5,"Went there for the first time last night and was greeted by Emily herself. Had camp Randall, Angelina, and banana pudding for dessert. I was going to give this place four stars for friendly service, delicious pizza and wine, and a great (though a tad too loud) atmosphere. Then I read the negative reviews complaining about being asked to keep a screaming baby quiet, about not getting prompt take out pizza, and about how Williamsburg has infected Clinton Hill. And I was reminded how awful restaurants are where they don't try to minimize screaming kids, where they prioritize pick ups and deliveries over those customers who are eating in, and the snobbery and poor service of many wburg joints. And am increasingly thankful that Emily was not any of those things. So 5 stars it is!"
358967,2014-10-12,349,58387,0,5,"An exceptional time from the food to the service. Unique and delicious food in incredibly thoughtful combinations. Thanks, Emily!"
358968,2014-10-08,349,22760,0,5,"Best pizza in Brooklyn hands down. Forget Roberta's, Emily is where it's at. This place is always busy. Plan ahead for at least a 45 minute wait. But Emily herself (she oftentimes works the front at the host) will text and call you as soon as something opens up. Decor is very 'Brooklyn chic' - super comfortable but feels special. Definitely a great place for a relaxed date or a dinner with friends. The music is PERFECT - good old school tunes that almost make you want to dance. The space itself may be small but it's put together well to make a great atmosphere. Now on to the food... UNREAL. The Colony pizza is one of my favorites. Both spicy and sweet all at the same time. Any white pizza is delicious but super dense so come hungry. The classic Luca is also always a good bet. The pasta dishes are incredible too - the pesto is fabulous. Pair these with the wine on tap (it's actually so good!) and finish the meal with the S'mores calzone. Woah woah sooooo good. This place is a hidden gem run by an awesome couple. Reasonable prices. Be prepared for a lively night filled with incredible food."
358969,2014-10-04,349,161122,0,1,"EMILY HYLAND, the restaurant OWNER basically asked my family to leave tonight because my one-year old was too loud. We had been there all of 7 minutes. My son screamed ONCE.. she came over to our table and said ""please try and keep your children quiet so as not to disturb the adult patrons""....and then went on to say that ""they expect children to be seated and quiet when dining at EMILY"" Oh OK. I guess she thinks that we're raising wild banshees who purposely disrupt ""adult-friendly eating establishments."" I should probably sit my 1-year old down (or maybe strap him his highchair so that he REALLY listens) and have a stern talk with him. Thanks, Emily! You've enlightened me. Seriously, what owner speaks to customers this way? I am a life-long resident of Clinton Hill and I've never felt so unwelcome in my own neighborhood. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try the pizza, because naturally after being spoken to that way, we got up to leave. Pretty sure, that's what she wanted. We will never go back. We ended up going to Graziella on Vanderbilt - pizza is great and they are nice, gracious and adult AND family-friendly."
358970,2014-10-04,349,3235,0,5,"Emily may be the best pizza I've had. Ever. If not, it's definitely top 5. Their pies are inventive and some of them are unlike anything I've seen elsewhere. And they're actually surprisingly big. I came here for lunch and split two pies with a friend. It was a lot of food, but it was so good that I kept eating until I hated myself (I do that a lot). For the sake of variety, we went with one red and one white. The red was The Colony, which came with pepperoni, pickled chili and honey. The chilis were amazing - not too spicy, and gave it just the right amount of kick. The honey was subtle, and not overpowering. Every bite was a combination of salty (pepperoni), spicy (chilis), sweet (honey), or all three. You really need to try this one. Our second pie was the eponymous Emily. This one was definitely sweeter (we were warned beforehand when ordering). I've never had crushed pistachio on a pizza, but it works. Really well, in fact. It also had truffle cheese and a generous honey glaze. Since it was sans sauce, this one was baked a little crispier, which made it that much more amazing. Between the pistacchios and the truffles, there was a nice balance of savory to go along with the sweet. They also have good beers on tap and whiskey! But it was 12:30 in the afternoon (that means I only had a beer). Our server was super friendly. She provided us with wonderful recommendations/conversation, and kept the indie tunes playing on the stereo. The decor of the place is also great. It has elements of cute (signs pointing you to the bathroom, handwritten notes in the bathroom, wine served in lab beakers), but also a cultured feel (an old map of New York and a wooden mandolin slicer on the wall). I will gladly come back to Emily until I have tried all of their pies."
358971,2014-09-27,349,136908,0,2,"I can only assume that the people giving this place 5 stars are friends of the owner.  Went there on Saturday night with a party of five and was made to feel less than welcomed by the owner manning the front - who had the audacity to repremand our party for being on time for our reservation.   We were seated in the back next to the oven and told to keep the area clear because of food preparation (I would think that management would have thought of that before putting a table in the kitchen).  The pizza was salty but the wine was good.  Our server was very sweet hence the 2 stars, but the owner left much to be desired and because of her this will be my first and last visit, not to mention any recommendation to anyone I know."
358972,2014-09-24,349,140701,0,3,"Wow!  Keep it down the kids are scared. Very hip place, but forgets where it is. Drinks took 20 min Food took 45 min and was kinda worth the wait, but don't ask me to keep it down 4 times when the bar is 10x louder than the dining room. Good fare, slow service and nervous nelly ownership. Loosen up please!"
358973,2014-09-14,349,15633,0,5,"Holy Yum!   Intimate little joint with great beer, delicious pizza and a lovely waitstaff.  We were sat by the owner, Emily, with choice of table or bar - I just love sitting at the bar for dinner... not sure why, but I do.  You can tell that she loves her place and takes great care of the atmosphere; not only with her demeanor, but by a happy staff (at least, it seemed as much from the bar)   Anyway, the kale salad and the Emily pizza were just out of this world.  I tend to go for red sauced pizzas but with truffle-infused cheese & honey, this pizza just couldn't be passed down.   Can't wait to try more!!"
358974,2014-09-12,349,103088,0,4,delicious pizza
358975,2014-09-12,349,2954,0,5,"LOVE this place. they have unique, creative pizzas, like the namesake. On our second visit, we tried the burger, which was great!"
358976,2014-09-09,349,33150,0,2,"Wow. I admit, I'm flummoxed by the high ratings for this place. All I can conclude is that Brooklynites really like their salt! The food here was abysmal. We got the Brussels sprouts, which we had to send back to the kitchen because they were inedible (and I never send stuff back, I hate to waste the food!). When we told the waitress it was too salty, she had the balls to condescendingly tell us (two Asian women, no less), ""Oh, no, it's because of the fish sauce."" I had to break it to her that we knew what fish sauce was. We also ordered a salad, pizza, and pasta. The pizza was all right, but still too salty (though nothing near the sprouts), as was the pasta. I thought I was going to walk out with kidney failure by the end of the meal. The only reason this place got 2 stars and not one is because they ended up taking the sprouts off the bill."
358977,2014-09-09,349,161123,0,5,"Delicious thin crust pizza that won't disappoint! You have options of red and  white pizzas plus pink or tomatillo. The service is very good, too."
358978,2014-09-08,349,161124,0,5,Great pizza cooked in a 1000F wood fired oven for less than a minute. Very authentic and delicious. The Caesar salad was tasty and served with whole romaine and anchovies. Small candlelit dining room makes an excellent date spot.
358979,2014-09-05,349,161125,0,5,"Emily has hands down the best pizza I've had in ages and ages, and it actually comes pretty close to the best pizza I've ever had. And this comes from a girl who ones went to Rome to eat nine pizzas in seven days. Beautiful ingredients on a thin, crisp and slightly charred crust - what more could one ask for? The Clinton Hill location is just lovely, so are the friendly staff - although it annoyed me a little they seemed awed that I ate a pizza by myself. What? Doesn't everyone eat their own pizza? Carbs, come on in! And oh, try the lavender lemonade - a great thirst quencher."
358980,2014-09-01,349,161126,0,4,The Pizza and Burgers here are very delicious. You should try them. The Specials are especially great.
358981,2014-08-31,349,15896,0,5,My favorite pizza place in NY. Everything is really tasty.
358982,2014-08-27,349,36021,0,4,The pizza was delllllicious. And they served me even though I came in at closing time.
358983,2014-08-12,349,97354,0,5,"This review is for the PIZZAS. They are absolutely amazing. I've never sat down to eat there, I just take out. Every time is always amazing. My favorite is the Wrestler. The pepporoni they use in their pizzas would make a vegetarian question themselves.  The prices are kind of high, but they could definitely be higher. A medium/small sized pie with 3-4 toppings was about $18 with taxes."
358984,2014-08-12,349,161127,0,5,"Emily, both the restaurant and the owner, is AMAZING. Hands-down, best pizza in Brooklyn. The food blows me away every time. Get there early, seats are in high demand but very much worth the wait. If you don't have time, order it to go. And please, try the Q."
358985,2014-08-11,349,161128,0,4,"Yes! My boyfriend and I went to Emily last night and it was fantastic. We got the Colony and the Lady Pizza Girl at the recommendation of other Yelpers, and they were both tasty and interesting. I had never had honey on pizza before, and it's definitely something I'll be trying at home in the near future! The two pizzas were enough for our meal and we still had some left over for lunch today. The service was wonderful, and a woman named Emily (maybe the owner?) checked in on us a couple of times to see that we were doing alright. The decor was nice, and the selection of music was also fantastic. The place is a little pricey, but it was worth it for the awesome pizza and the cozy atmosphere."
358986,2014-07-22,349,161129,0,5,"Umm...yes, yes, yes and more yes. We first ran into the owners of Emily when they co-opened Brooklyn Central in Park Slope. A few months of weekly (and sometimes daily) attendance followed, but we fell off the BC wagon during Hurricane Sandy (work was a bit hectic). Much to our sadness, when we returned, we discovered the owners had parted ways, and while we loved the food, much of what we enjoyed about BC was the atmosphere created by Emily as manager/hostess. Happily, the party's just moved a little uptown! Emily continues to serve most excellent pizza, and the cocktails aren't too shabby either! After our triumphal reunion with this fabulous food, we vowed to bring a group of friends with us...and we did! I'm happy to say they were all very pleased, too, and we are planning more trips to Emily. I could go through the list of pizzas and tell you about each one, but what a waste. If you've read this far, you hardly need to hear me go on even more. What I will say is that my partner and I have had, between us, 4 pizzas and our friends had 3 others, and no one said anything beyond variations of ""yum"" or ""I want more."""
358987,2014-07-21,349,161130,0,5,"Growing up in Brooklyn, you learn to know your pizza. This place does not mess around, and also offers other options to buffer your pie. I'm mightily impressed. You should eat here."
358988,2014-07-16,349,2040,0,2,"The good: Cute and cozy spot, nice brick oven, interesting pizza options, nice branding that doesn't feel like a traditional fancy pizza place. The not-so-good: We ordered food to go so we could eat it with friends over at Hot Bird, but the food took w-a-y longer than the 7 to 9-minute wait the hostess quoted. And when the food did arrive (without napkins), it was pretty lackluster. The sad little $9 portion of sugar snap peas could barely last beyond two bites. The William pizza, while flavorful, was kind of cold and soggy. Oh, and because waiting for our food took so long, we lost our table at Hot Bird and ended up having to eat our dinner on a random street bench. In the dark."
358989,2014-07-13,349,1423,0,5,"I'm not entirely sure who came up with the namesake pizza at Emily -- but when we figure out who came up with that delicious combination of sweet-savoury-salty-nutty, I want to kiss them for creating what is essentially the biggest gamechanger of pizzas I've had in my entire life. Aside from having our minds blown into oblivion by the Emily, our table also shared the Colony and the RM3! Each had their own unique and outstanding characteristics that separated it from the others. My next favourite would be the Colony, which was a surprisingly tasty mix of pickled chilis and honey on a red pie. For meatlovers, the RM3! is what you want -- it has what my friend calls ""all the meat you could ever dream of"" which is essentially a solid portion of sausage, pepperoni, and ham. Besides the food, the atmosphere is very pleasant, with lots of table space for everyone and plenty of drink options on the menu. Our waitress was also extremely pleasant and enjoyed our geeky humour so much that she asked us to come back with more of our friends. Personally, I'm already planning my next trip back for another dose of the Emily. If you have half a brain in your head, you will order this pie and thoroughly enjoy how amazing it is."
358990,2014-07-07,349,41771,0,5,"The pizza here is outstanding - yamahama - I almost punched a hole in the wall when I tasted one of Emily's pies for the very first time. ""The Emily"" gives Roberta's infamous ""Bee Sting"" a run for it's 'honey' ;-) I'm gonna go back for dinner soon because the pasta is probably sick. Mangiamo!"
358991,2014-07-01,349,7617,0,5,"I've tried many pizza places in the NYC area since graduating college and exploring the food scene here. Some serve classic, yet delicious pizzas. Some serve greasy, sub-par pizza by the slice. Others, like Emily, wow you by creating a masterpiece out of their pizza pies. Emily is slightly out of the way, in the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn, but well-worth the traveling time. My friend and I shared: Crispy Sprouts-apples, Worcestershire, chilis, black sesame RM3! Pizza- sauce, fontina, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto Emily Pizza-mozzarella, taleggio, pistachios, truffle spread, honey S'Mores Calzone- marshmallow, chocolate, graham cracker The Crispy Sprouts were too salty, even for me. However, the flavors were great. The RM3! Pizza was meaty and spicy. Great blend for pizza. The namesake, the Emily Pizza, was mind-blowing. Perfect combination of salty, crunchy, savory, and sweet. It sounds like an odd combination of ingredients but they all work together to make a harmonious pizza pie. The s'mores calzone was a perfect ending to our pizza journey."
358992,2014-06-25,349,3707,0,4,"Definitely a fan! I arrived on a Saturday night at about 7pm or so and the wait wasn't bad at all. table was just paying and we were quickly seated by Emily herself! It's not a big place and I'm pretty sure as it gets more popular the wait will get really long. I had the Colony and the name sake Emily. Both were amazing!! I appreciated the twist on the Colony with the pickled chili. They make their pies a little different so it's not just a copy of the famed Roberta's bee sting. The namesake Emily was so different from any pie I've ever had with the truffled cheese. Delicioso!! Crust was just a tad too thick for my preference but nevertheless I still loved the pies. I really wanted to order the smores calzone, but it looked ginormous for two people. We ended up bringing home most of the two pies anyway. I'll certainly be returning to try other pies and the calzone! I'm pretty sure Emily is going to blow up sooner than later."
358993,2014-06-23,349,161131,0,5,"This seriously might be the best pizza I've ever had in my life. The backstory of the restaurant is so cute with the husband as the chef and Emily as the greeter. The wine selection and cocktails were well thought out and the north maple pizza was incredible. I don't know who would think to include bacon, pecans and maple syrup on a pizza but it's freaking delicious. Definitely my new go to stop!"
358994,2014-06-23,349,161132,0,5,We live in the neighborhood and probably go to Emily once a week. We went with a bunch of friends this Sat night for my bday and had an amazing time! Emily and the entire staff are so friendly!  We ordered about everything off the menu and everything was great! So happy to have a restaurant like Emily in the neighborhood!
358995,2014-06-22,349,1901,0,5,"Stopped in for brunch on a delirious lovely June Sunday afternoon.  WOW! That's all that I can say. We shared The Colony  a pizza with sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, pickled chilis, honey.  I know - we didn't see how it could work either, but it did - oh boy it did!  The honey set off the chiles, the heat (not so much) from the chilis delightfully set off by the sweetness of the honey.  The pepperoni only added to the taste delight.  The crust was charred, but not overly so and the pizza went down quickly and happily. We also share a sandwich called the Noht Mi - It had something called Brooklyn Banger sausage, and something else called hot Nguyen sauce and it was accompanied by onions, relish, and mayo.  On bread that might have been a cross between, well I really don't know what the bread was, but it was great as was the sandwich - like the pizza it was hot and sweet at the same time.  A great taste sensation! Walking distance from out home in Prospect Heights - Emily's is in our rotation - Need to try it for dinner too!"
358996,2014-06-22,349,47682,0,4,"I am proud to say I helped voted in their liquor license.  And I am rewarded with a nice glass of red wine that is reasonably priced.  The salads, olives, pasta, pizza all worth the wait!  I love to sit at the bar alone or with company and just watch the pizza making.  Such a great addition to our neighborhood. Emily is the wife of the chef and they own it together.  Such a lovely couple that you can feel that they not only love each other but their restaurant! As I type this I am trying to figure out when this week I am going to get back over there.  Need to have an Emily fix often!"
358997,2014-06-16,349,3511,0,4,"I love love love Emily's!! As far as specialty pies go, I'd have to say that Emily's takes the cake, or I guess I should say, pie when it comes to my fave in Brooklyn! I dream about and regularly crave their namesake pizza, the Emily! Oh-My-God, this pizza is unreal-- mozzarella, pistachios, truffle and honey makes for the perfect combination of salty, savory and sweet. I've had other pizzas with similar ingredients, however, never as well executed as Emily's-- the perfect ratio of truffle and honey.  I really can't even handle how much I love this pizza. The Colony is another good, unique choice and I love the balance between spicy(pickled chili) and sweet(honey). As far as their classic goes, it was good, but not the best I've ever had. They also have pasta dishes, with pasta made fresh from Sfoglini Pasta Shop. The cavatelli was soooo delicious! Mmm.lemon, ricotta and poppy combined to make an insanely flavorful bowl of pasta. I loved that the lemony flavor really came through without being overpowering. As far as dessert goes, the S'mores Calzone is  AMAZING. I must preface this by saying that, s'mores might be one of my favorite treats so I am partial to loving this dessert. Mmmm the dough is perfectly charred with crumbled graham cracker crust and it comes oozing with marshmallow and chocolate--d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!!! I'm pretty sure I could eat the Emily and S'mores calzone every day and live a very happy life."
358998,2014-06-08,349,78978,0,4,"Lovely little place hidden on Fulton. The owner greeted us when we walked in and we had excellent service throughout the evening. Cocktails were delicious and strong. We had a colony pizza and the trumpet pasta with duck rage. Both were tasty, but the stand outs of the evening were our two starter plates: snap peas, and homemade ricotta. I could have eaten a bucket of both. I think this place beats Franny's any day and will definitely be a staple in our rotation."
358999,2014-06-03,349,161133,0,5,"I am for health reasons a gluten free vegetarian with limited use of eggs and dairy.  I always find something to eat when I join family and friends at food establishments, but my meal is not always exciting or delicious.  I was extremely pleased and excited when the owners and staff at Emily made my eating experience as wonderful as my family's.  They served me amazing dishes from appetizers through dessert.  The dishes my family had looked delicious and the comments that were passed around the table reinforced that fact.  But, I did not feel like I missed anything, because my food was so terrific in flavor, texture and ingredients used!! Often when I go out to eat, the restaurant staff look at me-like why are you here, you can't eat anything.  At Emily, I felt extremely welcome and everyone was eager to go out of their way to make my experience as wonderful as everyone else.  I will definitely go back there!!  The place feels like home with a classy atmosphere and the food is terrific even for people on special diets!!  You can't say that about many restaurants!!  And, from the laughter and happy faces I saw throughout the evening, I gathered everyone else there was having the same amazing experience my family and I were having!!!"
359000,2014-06-01,349,38851,0,2,the most average place I've ever been.
359001,2014-05-27,349,45518,0,4,"Great small pizza place, you better expect to wait for a table. Small cozy pizza place which is good for small groups of diners. The pizzas are made in a brick oven so they are top of the line. Save space for the dessert, i recommend you try the s'more calzone!"
359002,2014-05-18,349,65517,0,5,"Cute neighborhood restaurant with a few 'pros' that set it above the rest in that category. Emilys has that hallway design of a lot of places; thin storefront that goes deep into the block. You can see the wood fired oven in the back and their menu is definitely pizza centric, but with a few pastas and some very good small plates and apps as well. Pizzas are all good if you like thin-crust but not super-crispy. Apps include a really nice selection of kale, snow peas, pig ears (chewy but awesome) and brussell sprouts. Above all that is that they are very friendly here. I have been by 3 times, the third time I came in for a light snack and was perpetually bothered by a crazy lady who got furious at me for not having a bite of her pizza, she was weird and left, and the staff were unbelievably apologetic and kind about it, more than was expected. Anyhow, brooklyn gets a bad rap for having too cool for school service in the restaurants, an unfortunate byproduct of being the more casual borough, Emilys is certainly a neighborhood place, and one I feel very comfortable visiting."
359003,2014-05-17,349,3434,0,4,"Pizza for breakfast? Why not? After a few friends and I decided to come here for brunch, I think I can get on board with the whole egg-pizza thing. Our table had the North Maple, Suburban Hangover and Colony pies. Everything was awesome, but the winner by far was the North Maple. Perfect crust, and awesome blends of flavors. Drinks seem to be pricey for this area, but you can't have pizza without...mimosas. Yeah, you read that right!"
359004,2014-05-16,349,161134,0,3,The pizza is very good and the staff is helpful and friendly but take ear plugs or buy stock in hearing aid companies.  For me the food is not worth shouting your way through dinner.
359005,2014-05-14,349,3633,0,5,"Okay, I know that when like 30 of my reviews call each pizza ""the best pizza I've had in New York"" or ""the best pizza I've ever had"" it starts to lose its meaning a bit, but the problem is that I keep finding better and better pizza. I really don't think it's possible to find better pizza than this, though. Our group of four tried the Colony (pickled chili, pepperoni, tomato sauce, mozzarella, and honey) and the  Emily (mozzarella, pistachios, truffle sottocenere, honey). They were both so, so, so, so good. I usually try to savor my food rather than inhaling it, but I couldn't stop myself with these pizzas. We also sampled the Brooklyn Bangers sausage (sausage with grits and house relish). It was quite good, but I could check out another of the small plates next time. The drinks are great as well; I tried the leaning fields (lavender lemonade and vodka) and loved it. Finally, I really appreciated the friendly service. We showed up on a Saturday at 8:30 and were told we'd have about a 45-minute wait (I was expecting much worse). After about 50 minutes we got an update text from the hostess letting us know that our table wasn't quite ready because the previous group was lingering, and that she would text us the second the table was ready. She even included little pizza emoticons. I've waited hours for tables before with no updates at all, so I thought the update was really thoughtful. We ended up waiting about an hour and ten minutes total. It wasn't too bad of a wait since we enjoyed drinks at Hanson Dry in the interim. :) I will be back. Hopefully many times."
359006,2014-05-11,349,6840,0,2,"OK, someone downthread called it Williamsburg pizza and I have to agree... I am not a hater & if that's what you like by all means have a great time. The people are nice the prices are reasonable but I'm sorry it's just not my style. I am a native NYer and things like honey or duck fat are not pizza ingredients in my humble opinion."
359007,2014-05-07,349,161135,0,5,"This place is awesome, can't believe this was tucked away on Fulton street and I never knew about it till now! We got the Angelina (white pizza with kale, ricotta and lemon) and some other white pizza with ricotta,  mozzarella and sausage. The crust was perfectly thin and the toppings were refreshingly creative without being too much. Drinks were a little pricey but the wine selection is decent and the cocktails are totally worth the extra couple bucks. I got the Leaning Fields- a homemade lavender lemonade spiked with vodka- and it was every bit as amazing as it sounds. We got there around 5:30pm on a Saturday and it was mostly families with little kids, but I have a feeling the scene is much different around 8 or 9, with the fully stocked bar I saw in back. Didn't notice any outdoor seating but maybe it's too early in the season? Overall great experience, I'll definitely be back!"
359008,2014-05-04,349,161136,0,5,"Another killer time at Emily. A wonderful busy night for them, so I took a seat at the bar. Brussels sprouts were awesome, a big ole plate that wasn't overwhelmed by the tasty fish sauce (nicely balanced by the apples).  Spaghetti with the poached egg was awesome. Great spicy heat from the 'nduja sausage, while the egg coats the pasta in a fabulous sauce. Music choice was AMAZING. The party in my mouth was accompanied by the music in my ears. Well done again Emily."
359009,2014-04-24,349,28924,0,2,"Don't bother. The problem is the wet, flabby, and pointless ""crust."" Ruins what might otherwise be decent pizza. Why can't they keep the crust crisp? On the plus side, the salads are fresh and spare. Service is fine; space is unremarkable. Not at all worth the trip from Manhattan."
359010,2014-04-24,349,25821,0,5,"Emily, won't you please be our best friend!?! This was pretty much all my boyfriend and I could think of from the moment we were seated by Emily, herself, the restaurant's owner. We've been back there so many times since they opened, I've lost count. It's really THAT good. Emily is small and intimate, and currently doesn't take reservations for less than 6 people. Therefore, on the weekends, be prepared to grab a drink at Hanson Dry next door while you wait for a call. The place itself is very ""Brooklyn."" Dark, with stark art on the wall, good music always playing, and lots of drink options to choose from. The waitresses are attentive, and remember the regulars (hiii!). This isn't your typical pizza restaurant. Everything on the menu has been thought out with care, and you can both see and taste it. For appetizers, we always get the Crispy Sprouts (you will never look at brussel spouts the same way again). They are charred to perfection. I've heard from fellow customers that the flatbread is good, but I haven't tried it yet. The pizzas are all amazing. We usually try to do a red and a white. The Colony (a red) has pepperoni, pickled chili, and honey - what an amazing combination! For vegetarians like me, you must try the Olympus Mons - pickled chili and arugula - it's to die for. For the Whites, we always get the namesake, The Emily. It comes with mozzarella, pistachios, truffle sottocenere, and honey. It. Is. Amazing. I mean, really. I didn't know pizza could taste like this. The gist of Emily is that you really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas. For dessert, we dared to try the S'Mores Calzone. Be prepared - it's gigantic and very, very rich. I was overwhelmed after a few bites. Overall, this place is an experience which leaves me wanting to come back every time. So Emily, won't you please be our best friend?!"
359011,2014-04-22,349,26643,0,5,"We got to Emily right as brunch was ending (I think even 5 minutes after) and they still let us stay!  SCORE.   Thank you kitchen crew! We ordered fast - but still made some damn good selections. First thing we chowed down on  were the grits.  They were awesome - I'm from the south so I know good grits.  The arugula that came with them were a surprisingly delicious pairing. Add on the bacon and BAM.  So amazing grits right there. We had the  Emily pizza - which was a white pizza with  truffle, honey, crushed pistachio -- OMG.  If sex was food - it might be this pizza.  Jesus.  SO. GOOD.  MIND BLOWN. The cocktails were unique and delicious - including one that had lavender lemonade and vodka. Great experience - great food. Go Go Go."
359012,2014-04-22,349,46500,0,4,"This place was SO good I just had to write a review. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the pizza was fresh from the oven, and the s'mores were the size of my face!! Haha! Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."
359013,2014-04-21,349,18792,0,4,"Very cute place! The pizza is 5 stars! We had ""the colony"" which had sauce, pepperoni, pickled chiles and honey. It was salty, sweet and spicy- all in one bite! The dough was thin and crispy. The sauce was delicious and everything tasted really good! Had the Lil Rhody also for brunch, which was good, but not great. Next time, I would try more pizza instead or come for dinner and try their pasta dishes. Pastas are not offered during brunch."
359014,2014-04-19,349,38922,0,2,"I got take out from Emily about a week ago. The food was great, even though the portions are a little small. However, tonight I wanted to call, order and pick it up. I have called a total of 11 times and the one time someone did pick up they immediately hung up on me. I work in retail management and no matter how busy you are you ALWAYS answer the phone. Apparently it's their policy to not pick up the phone during service hours because they get too busy. The place was barely full last night! I've never in my life heard of a restaurant that operates like that. Also one where you can walk in and get take out but heaven forbid you want to call ahead of time. I've been to much busier places that have the wherewithal to know that you answer the phone, take reservations and do take out. Emily put a really bad taste in my mouth. I will no longer give them my business."
359015,2014-04-13,349,6830,0,4,"My wife is named Emily. Emily loves pizza. Therefore, a pizza establishment named Emily was a foregone conclusion. We started with the Crispy Sprouts. Very tasty with a bit of a kick. For our pizzas, we tried the Emily and the Rafa. While the Emily was more unique, they were both very good. I found that the amount of two pizzas was ideal for two adults and a small amount of leftovers. I'd also recommend getting a red and white pizza in that scenario. It is a small place, so plan to have a drink at a nearby pub or wine bar while you wait. Some very enticing small plates, spaghetti,  and pizza combinations. I look forward to going back!"
359016,2014-04-12,349,49281,0,5,Went to Emily for the first time last night. Had to wait to get in which was a good sign. Got the wrestler and the colony pizza. Both were delicious but I liked the colony better. Staff was very friendly. Beer and wine selection was good but I hope they add some rotating beers on tap. Will definitely be back. A little on the pricey side for pizza but worth it.
359017,2014-04-11,349,44814,0,3,"These are initial pizza impressions only and should be 3.5 stars I tried the Luca and Olympus Mons. Something seems unusual about the crust. It's very flat, yet pliant. I think they're using 00 flour but perhaps are not proofing it overnight? There's almost no puff that you see at places like Saraghina, Roberta's or Paulie Gees. Last night they might have been having temperature control problems with the oven... the char is pronounced but the pizza didn't have the snap or rigidity I expected from the color.  Tomato sauce had a high acidity but needed some olive oil. Couldn't tell where they came from.  The service was very nice and the pizza came quickly.   I really like the wine list and will be back to test out more dishes.   Best"
359018,2014-04-08,349,3429,0,3,"Meh.  I guess this might have been a little overhyped by the time I actually made it in to a table (after trying to come the night before and being turned away due to an hour wait).  The service was fantastic and the place is really cute, but the pizzas we ordered weren't that exciting.  The Classic had very little cheese (which is the number one way a restaurant can annoy me: skimp on cheese).  We also got the Q which was better--maybe stick with the white pizza side of the menu?  Anyway, Emily is fine but probably not worth an hour's wait.  It sort of reminded me of a less-good version of Keste in the West Village--the crust was not as flavorful.  Go if you're around and there's no wait; otherwise there are plenty of other places nearby."
359019,2014-04-05,349,161137,0,5,"Thank god we got in when we did. There was but one table for two available at 6PM on a Friday evening. When you've got about 10 tables and a storefront the width of a taxicab, space for dining is at a premium. Get a reservation if you've got more than 2. Pizzas about the size of a car steering wheel, prices range from $14-19, and absolutely worth the price of admission. I was under a lot of pressure too. The buddy I was with doesn't have the New York experience that I do, and absolutely insisted that we get GOOD New York pizza for dinner. Emily saved my reputation. Every single pizza is thoughtfully crafted. The ""Colony,"" which is indeed named after the one and only Colony Grill in Stamford, was the star of the show. Sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, jalapenos, pickled chili sauce, and a honey drizzle finish. *makes ""mind blown"" gesture* What the WHAT? All of it on daily fresh made dough, fired super hot, a little of that good New Haven-style burnt edge, served with a smile. The RM3 was also an excellent pie, which you might call their ""meat lover's."" If you're in the Barclay's Center area, it's a 10 minute walk. You must go."
359020,2014-04-05,349,47862,0,2,"Williamsburg has infected the area and this place shows.  The pizza was ok, not bad but far from great. Too much dough, pizzas are burned to spots of blackness underneath, sauce was forgettable,.  And the service is as fake as williamsburg trust fund hipsters. The crowd is excessively loud. The hipster music channel on pandora blaring doesn't make for a good dining experience."
359021,2014-04-03,349,120541,0,5,Gorgeous new space. The pizza was divine. Amazing flavor combinations. Waitstaff was attentive and recommended some yummy wines. Tried the colony which was delish--super spicy and sweet. The Emily (my fave) was out of this world. Definitely have the intention of trying all!
359022,2014-04-02,349,161138,0,4,"Great addition to Fulton Street, great food, friendly staff, and a few doors down from Hanson Dry which is a real plus. First time there and we will add it to our list of local faves. You have to be really good at pizza to make ""the list"" in Brooklyn and this is great pizza.Only complaint is one I find most common lately, who wrote the loud music rule?"
359023,2014-03-31,349,6633,0,4,"We stopped into Emily for Saturday brunch and I have to say I was very happy with the experience.  Truly delicious pizza walking distance from the ol' apartment?  Heck yes, suckah! Atmosphere:  Current.  Cozy.  Simple. Pizza:  Thin.  Crispy.  Lightly-charred (yum!) Service:  Friendly. The only hiccup in the experience was a temporary ice emergency that left us waiting a few minutes for our drinks.  We were compensated handsomely with a delicious ice cream sandwich courtesy of the house.  Perfectly handled. I'm super excited to add Emily to our regular restaurant rotation and explore the menu more. Try it... you'll like it!"
359024,2014-03-22,349,161139,0,5,"Amazing food, great service, and the owner came out to ask how out night was. Totally coming back."
359025,2014-03-13,349,3416,0,4,"super cute place with yummy food! i've had a number of their pizzas now (two visits in two weeks) and the standout is the ""emily"" pizza (honey & pistachio, whattttt!!!) and the smores calzone. also, they have wine on draft (always fun) and they have very friendly staff. totally a great place to hit up in clinton hill! minor quibbles: i definitely liked the pizza more than the pasta and the dough is a smidgen salty but I also am not huge on copious amounts of salt so..take it with a grain of... you know, nevermind..."
359026,2014-03-10,349,134590,0,1,"Came here for brunch last weekend and ordered the kale salad and Emily pie. About five hours later the nausea started, then vomiting, then everything else associated with food poisoning. Was up all night and still sick the next day. Based on the stellar reviews, I'm guessing this was an isolated incident but I won't be dining here again."
359027,2014-03-10,349,57337,0,5,"Had a wonderful dinner for 5 people on a early Sunday night. Emily's does more than just pizza and has solid range of dishes to make it a worthwhile foodie dinner experience. Would definitely go again. Servers, bartender and host were all super nice. It is a small place so there may be a wait.  Salads, pastas, pizzas all terrific. Wine list can use some changes. Recap of what we had below  (course by course). Dinner for five so we got to sample a lot of stuff. Had the cheese and meat platter - nice assortment of both, with nuts, honey, and apples as sides. The variety of cheese and meats plus extras are on a beautiful dark wood board with warm flatbread on the side making it a great starter for groups. I would not get this for dinner for two (just too much) We loved the Caesar or kale salad. Wonderfully light but flavorful dressing. Salad was not wilted. Our group definitely thought these were solid starters. The Brussels sprouts is interesting. Very rich and a bit too salty for my taste buds but the sprouts have a char on the outside and seemed steamed or boiled on the inside which gives it a nice textural range. Reminded me of David chang's vegetables at one of his restaurants. I'm sure this will be a very popular dish. Pasta - we had two to start and then ordered a third. That is how much we enjoyed them: bucatini, trumpet and cavatelli were all excellent and different. Portions were not big but neither were the prices. Duck ragu was hearty, Pasta perfectly al dente and delicious. Bucatini nice and spicy and authentic. Cavatelli was popping with poppy seeds + tart / lemony flavor and a great non-meat dish. Overall we liked the pastas a lot because they were not over sauced and were cooked perfectly. Pizza - I am a FANatic of Pizza at Roberta's, Franny's, Paulie Gee's. I would put this place slightly below but still yummy with potential to have its own unique version of Neapolitan style pizza. The pizza dough is very tasty, chewy and not dry, slightly thicker, flatbread-doughy style rather than the extreme thin crust pizzas elsewhere. The night we went there, the sauces and toppings were a bit on the bland side. Could have used some more seasoning, but still very yummy, just not as heavenly as let's say...Roberta's or Franny's. Overall it was good pizza I would have again without hesitation. Wine - probably the only thing we didn't like were the wines. We had two bottles of red and some wines by the glass. Was disappointed at the overall wine selection and also the wine glasses (goblets) which I don't care for.  My first bottle was a French Bordeaux which was just disappointing. Then we had a Oregon Pinot noir which was better but not worth the price. I've had plenty of better wines at other places for similar prices. Overall a really nice, friendly and delicious new place."
359028,2014-03-10,349,15445,0,4,"Ive eaten at Emily's three times now.  The first time was beyond amazing.  The pizza dough is flavorful.  The crust is crispy and they have interesting toppings.  Ive ordered the pig ear salad which was delicious with crispy pig ears and nice accompanying greens.  The s'more calzone is huge and addictive.  I went for brunch and had the arctic char pizza.  It was good but could more cheese and less salt.  The last two times Ive gone there have been minimal growing pains such as long waits for food and missing toppings from my pizza.  Overall, Emily's is the best pizza Ive had in Brooklyn.  It is already becoming crazy popular and I forsee long waits in the not so distant future."
359029,2014-03-08,349,18117,0,5,"I came with my entire family and we got there right on time for them to seat us all (8 people, 5:30) before it got crowded. Servers were really friendly, Emily herself was there and also very friendly, and the pizzas and salads (and Brussel sprouts) were outstanding!! I especially recommend the Luca pizza, and the arugula salad. Finished with the s'mores calzone - YUM! A great addition to the neighborhood."
359030,2014-03-04,349,161140,0,5,"My date and I had an amazing time here.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  Something I really appreciate is the quick ""we'll be right with you"" when its extremely busy. Almost every table was filled and they were still attentive to us. I thought all the food was pretty much perfect.  We had the crispy pig ears.  Ive never had pig ears with an acidic vinagrette over greens and it worked amazingly well. I was  a little worried about ordering such a classic dish as the Bucatini all'amatriciana because well I've had it before.  But it was  perfect (tho maybe just a dash too salty).  What really stood out was the quality of the pasta.  It was so toothsome and rich.  The sauce was so savory that I was stopping to close my eyes and take in the flavors of the acidic tomato, funky guanciale and salty nuttiness of the pecorino. Lastly we had the Emily pie.  The crust was very flavorful with the perfect amount of chew.  The combination of pistachio, honey, taleggio and truffles was amazing.  The intense aroma of truffle fills your nose as you bite into a rich and sweet pie.  A real experience. Lastly I just want to suggest a delicious wine that goes great with many of these dishes.  A sparkling red, Gragnano Penisola Sorrentina.  Its complex and dry with a very light body. I'll be back soon.  Also if you've never had 'nduja before; get the pasta with it. I'm sure its great. I'm getting it next time. EDIT: I just read the story below about Emily and the person from London.  That sounds crazy and I'm sorry for that person's terrible experience.  I just wanted to say that Emily waited on us and she was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  So I dunno, sometimes people have bad nights?"
359031,2014-03-03,349,41730,0,5,"when tasting table sent me an email about this place, I was on it! As a pizza connoisseur that have been to Di Fara's, PaulyGee's, Roberta's, Grimaldi's and Franny's (unfortunately) this place is one classy act! unpretentious and full of personality, the food speak for itself! I cannot wait to bring my friends here from Manhattan and Astoria! thank you for the good work!  and don't forget to order the S'mores Calzone and Pizza Churros for dessert!!!! oh yes!!!"
359032,2014-03-02,349,112781,0,4,"A friend of mine suggested this place for dinner tonight and oh boy am I happy she did. It was packed when we got there at 6pm and the hostess said it would be an hour wait. About 30 minutes passed and my friend got a call from the restaurant-our table is ready! Service We didn't feel rushed and the waitresses were great with refilling water and checking in on us. When we asked for the check, it came right away and we didn't feel pressured to get dessert or any other drinks. Food (all pizzas have ammmmaaazing dough) -The Colony Pizza - delicious blend of spicy and sweet. Never had a pizza with honey as a topping but it worked so well to calm down the spicy from the peppers. -The Emily - pistachios, truffle, and a whole bunch of other goodness. A little too oily due to the truffle oil but it was still delicious with a nutty texture from the pistachios. -The Special - the night's special had a combo of white sauce, brussel sprouts, and some kind of meat. This was my favorite one of the night. I might be a little biased because I love brussel sprouts. Would I go back? Yes. I see this as a great spot to catch up with friends or to bring a first date. It reminded me of Saraghina from bedstuy, for those of you familiar with this pizzeria restaurant."
359033,2014-02-26,349,102109,0,5,"When somebody is doing something right, you should just say it! And Emily delivers a great dinner experience! The ambiance is cozy and elegant with some tables in the front and a great ""chef's"" table in the back right next to the pizza action! The food is just awesome: you can't go wrong with fried Brussels sprouts, duck trumpets are a great pasta option, and the Emily pizza is a must to try! Finally a great pizzeria in the area!"
359034,2014-02-25,349,56300,0,3,"This was not worth the trek out to Clinton Hill (from Manhattan) for us. There was an hour-long wait around 6pm on a Saturday although we didn't mind and the servers were very nice. We went next door to Hanson Dry for a drink and that was actually an awesome bar with some great cocktails... We split a pasta and a pizza for dinner. Both were decent, but not great. We were very excited to try the s'mores calzone for dessert, but didn't like it at all. It was enormous! Way too large for two people. It was basically the same dough as pizza... way too much crust relative to the chocolate and marshmallows inside. I kind of dug out the insides to get at the small part with the most chocolate and then we left the rest."
359035,2014-02-23,349,161141,0,5,"This place is wonderful!! Ok let's get the part about the long wait out of the way. We showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday, we were a party of four. Emily was extremely kind as she explained that it looked like it might be a 2 hour wait. She suggested we head next door for drinks which we did and they were great! I popped in an hour after we put our name on the list just to see if anything changed, again Emily was so nice and let me know that it wouldn't be as long as she thought. A few minutes later she called and we had a table. the total wait was about an hour and 20 minutes. Normally this kind of thing could be annoying but the way Emily handles the room is great!!!  When we sat down the waitress was great and Emily kept checking in on us. The wine selection was great and fairly priced. We specifically went for pizza so we decided to spilt three different pies. The pizza combos were interesting and thoughtful but not overly complex. The Dough was great, the sauce was amazing and the cheeses!! wow the cheeses!!  To top the experience off Emily was kind enough to give us a ice cream sandwich because we waited a while for our table. Needless to say we will all be going back. The only problem with this restaurant is it is not in my neighborhood."
359036,2014-02-23,349,49308,0,5,"Wow...just wow. I went in not expecting to have one of the best (if not the best) pizza I have ever tasted. I tried a lot of food there, but the specific pie I'm talking about is the Emily. It was perfection. The combination of extremely complimentary ingredients and perfectly cooked dough made this pie extraordinary. We also ordered the Millette, Sprouts and Pig Ear plates. All ridiculously good. The other pies we got were the Colony and Angie. Both of them were very delicious as well. I would recommend everything we had! The service was also excellent. I emailed to discuss a reservation and Emily answered very promptly. I had some questions and she was very patient and 100% responsive. In the restaurant, we were well taken care of by the friendly and knowledgeable staff. This doesn't really deserve losing a star, but it was really cramped. I don't mind small spaces and close proximity to my dining neighbor, but I figure some might. That all said, I can't wait until my next Emily venture."
359037,2014-02-20,349,161142,0,4,"Giving the 4 stars simply because it's a pizza place and the pizza is great. Awesome Neapolitan style pita like crust (which I'm partial too). Other than than, Brussels sprouts had good flavor but far too salty! Mixed cocktails we just ok. I found Emily herself to be extremely rude. Not really surprised about the story where the guy almost got arrested. She was super cold and defensive every time we asked a question. I'll probably still go back but only for the pizza."
359038,2014-02-19,349,161143,0,5,"get the fried brussel sprouts. get the emily pizza. emily, the owner is lovely, as is her husband, matt, the chef and pizza guy. cozy atmosphere. reasonably priced delicious wine. and a calzone stuffed with marshmallow and chocolate. there is nothing else you could possible want. except maybe an extra stomach. emily is da bomb."
359039,2014-02-15,349,146326,0,5,Awesome pie!  Super friendly service! Great addition to the neighborhood!
359040,2014-02-13,349,49686,0,3,"I dislike being the one to not rate full stars, It not like I didn't like this place. Most of the food was good expect the slightly burnt flat bread, it was huge though and the Cavatelli wasn't that good. The pasta was hard and overly lemon flavor, it was adult mac and cheese.....kids mac and cheese is better. I found the ""plate"" section to be fairly price but almost everything else overly priced. I don't know....I may or may not come back."
359041,2014-02-11,349,102178,0,5,"Great Brooklyn vibe, excellent pizza, and a dessert to die for.  What more can you ask for?  I had the lavender lemonade and must say it's delicious--not too sweet, not too tart.  My friend and I ordered the RM3! and Ears (a salad with pig ears).  The pig ears were yummy, kind of like bacon but crispier and less fatty.  The RM3! pizza, a meatlovers pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and prosciutto was very balanced.  The dough was soft and chewy, the sauce complemented the cheese very well and the meats were high quality.  We tried S'mores Calzone and Pizza Churros for dessert.  The Pizza Churros is a nice dessert, but the S'mores are incredible.  If you are getting the S'mores, at least two people should share it. Friendly staff and great food. Cheers!"
359042,2014-02-11,349,161144,0,5,"The food was perfect. The wine was perfect. The atmosphere was perfect. The staff was perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. My friends and I tried some salads, cheeses, pizza and pasta. Everything we had was amazing and did not disappoint. The Emily pie is a must if you go here! My only regret is I didn't leave room to try the dessert. But that's okay because I will definitely be back!"
359043,2014-02-10,349,21152,0,5,"Believe the hype. This place is true and real. The atmosphere is chill. Good music. Small room. Polite staff. But it's the food that keeps you. The crust is crusty. The sauce is saucy. The cheese is cheesy. Seriously, perfect sauce and crust.  Possible best pizza in brooklyn?  You heard it here first.  Salad was good too. We will be back. Regularly. Welcome to the neighborhood, Emily."
359044,2014-02-09,349,161145,0,5,Came here for Sunday brunch. Everything we tasted was delicious. We ordered the kale salad which was simple but tasty. The Emily pizza was the best. Followed by the Q. Would definitely come back for dinner to try the other items not offered for brunch.
359045,2014-02-08,349,14671,0,5,"Made a reservation for an early dinner Saturday night and was lucky enough to be seated in the back where we watched all the action unfold in the open kitchen. This was also a rustic and warm spot to enjoy a quiet conversation. The courteous and friendly staff made great suggestions and got everything to us at the perfect time. I had a deliciously complex gin-cocktail (the Winglet) while my boyfriend enjoyed a rich chocolatey wine. We opened with the Stix, which gives you the chance to appreciate the crispy-yet-chewy texture of the dough against a simple, delightful garlic/basil flavor combination. We then moved onto the Camp Randall and the Emily. We agreed that the Camp Randall was rather standard, but that the Emily was truly outstanding and worthy of a namesake pizza. The flavor combination of the honey and truffle sottocenere worked wonderfully, while the pistachios offered a surprising crunch and further complemented the truffle flavor with their nuttiness.   At this point, we really didn't have much space left in our bellies... Though, we couldn't really leave without trying the S'mores Calzone, having watched so many of them puff up in the oven. This proved a good decision--the chocolate was perfectly dark, not too sweet, and made a perfect end to a lovely meal. Overall, Emily was a great dining experience--charming, delicious, and filled with hardworking, friendly people. We'll be back!"
359046,2014-02-07,349,3356,0,5,"Emily is like Franny's Marco, but with warmth and value. Emily herself is so charming and the restaurant follows suit. Prices are reasonable here so you could eat a real meal for a real price. The crew behind the original Brooklyn Central, bring that bangin' oven and pizza plus Sfoglini pastas with flair and flavor to Clinton Hill. A charcuterie plate of meats, cheeses, honey and figs was a heavenly start. The crispy pig ears salad over greens with mustard vinaigrette- hello food lover- this is for you. My favorite though was the pasta- Lemony cavatelli with ricotta and poppy seeds for $10. I was blown away by the lemony flavor- a true original like Emily herself. The smores pizza dessert is here plus others, but will save the sweet treat for next time."
359047,2014-02-06,349,161146,0,5,"I'm very spoiled with Pizza. Really, I have tried Lucali's, Di Fara's, John's at Bleekers, etc. Normally, I try the Margarita when I'm at a new place. It's just simple and if a place makes a good one, then I will try a different pie later. My wife and I was in a pizza mood and we heard of this Italian place about 10 minutes walk from us in Clinton Hill. We decided that we would have a glass of Wine and try something. I have to say we were blown away! First, the service was excellent! Very good, great atmosphere, nice decor and definitely friendly! It makes me feel like I am eating a nice meal with family (which I was, of course)! We saw some of the food being served and we though, ok, maybe we should try one of the specialty pizzas? When it comes to the best specialty pizza I have tried so far, well...... the Emily at Emily really did it for me! It put this Italian place on the map! The Emily was such a good white pizza with a combination of really nice cheese and other honey, etc. that we could not stop eating it! We had to try another one, the Colony. It was really good too. BUT, The Emily is currently my favorite of all specialty pizzas so far! We has 2 glasses of Cabernet. The wine was awesome! Just perfect. Just before the pizza, we tried the Kale salad. It was really enjoyable! Tasty with dried cherries, a really excellent combination! Anyway, just those dishes made this our Favorite Italian Pizza place to date!"
359048,2014-01-31,349,116424,0,5,"Can't say enough good things about this place. I stopped by last night at 6, with my wife and daughter for drinks and pre-dinner snacks. It was a great, I really enjoyed the cocktail; Leaning Fields, it was a delicious combination of homegrown lavender lemonade and vodka,etc. also loved the Botany Bay. The atmosphere was great, as well as the decor, the service was perfect, friendly informative and attentive. We also enjoyed the duck Brest, the olives and the flatbreads."
359049,2014-01-30,349,161147,0,5,"Had a great dinner here- fantastic pizza, the s'more pizza for dessert was a bit much but made a great late night snack later on. The service was excellent and reasonably priced. With service and food like this it is sure to be a success, I look forward to going back."
359050,2014-01-25,349,97930,0,5,"Great foods and great drinks, they have even pairing wines with pizza!! It was a great customer services. Overall, stylish, tasty, great restaurant :)"
359051,2014-01-25,349,5260,0,5,"""Pizza Loves Emily"" and I love Emily's pizza. The Emily that this great new spot is named after made this delicious meal even more enjoyable, as a gracious host providing excellent service. We arrived early on a Saturday night to find a very nice, cozy, welcoming atmosphere. It's a smallish place, with some tables and bar seating near the open kitchen with the large pizza oven in the back. The menu here is great, with a large number of starters and small plates, in addition to pastas and several pizzas, which are helpfully divided into two categories - The Reds and The Whites. For once, we didn't order way too much. Just a little too much: - Stix ($9) When I asked what this one was, Emily helpfully informed us that it was deep fried bread, and was their take on garlic knots. That was all I needed to hear to help me decide which of the many apps to start with. These were really delicious, especially those first few that were crispy and piping hot. There was a ton of garlic on them, which is always a good thing. After they sat for a bit, they were a little saturated with the oil though, which made them a little too heavy to deal with, but they were great when fresh. - Spaghetti with 'nduja, uni and pistachios ($16) This was some really amazing pasta. The spaghetti was cooked al dente with a nice chewy texture, and it had a great salty taste from the uni, with an added crunch from the pistachios. This is definitely a good choice to enjoy before the pizzas. - Rafa ($14) with pepperoni ($3) One of The Red pies, this one comes with mozzarella, sauce, peppers and onions. We also added some much needed meat with pepperoni, which came in large discs, with 2 to 3 on each of the 6 slices. The crust on this pizza was incredible. The pizza itself is very thin crust and is very chewy. It depends on whether or not this is the style you like, but if you can appreciate a good thin, chewy crust, you will love this. - Emily ($19) with sausage ($3) One of The White pies, I figured we had to try the namesake of the restaurant. Again fueling my need for meat, we added some sausage to the pie, which by default is topped with mozzarella, taleggio, pistachios, truffle spread and honey. This was another amazing pie, though I started getting a little overwhelmed with the copious amounts of delicious truffle spread. Still, that crust was on point too, with that great chewiness and crispiness at the same time. - S'mores Calzone ($10) They also have Pizza Churros ($8) and the always excellent Coolhaus Ice Cream Sandwiches for dessert ($7), but even without getting those, I know that you must get this S'mores Calzone, as it was truly incredible. The calzone is pretty big, and is cut up into 4 pieces, each one oozing with hot, melty, gooey chocolate, marshmallows and graham cracker crumbs. It's so fresh and hot that you should take a minute before you eat, or you will burn your mouth and hands. This was a good opportunity to chat with Emily. Once that was done, I really tore into this satisfying dessert. There is a really generous amount of that delicious, melted chocolate, spread all throughout that amazing pizza dough. Make sure you save room for this, or get it even if you are full. This is a perfect spot for a really nice, relaxing, satisfying meal. Brooklyn is getting saturated with this these similar types of pizza joints, but this one is among the best, and the great, friendly service is a welcome change from most places. I have had some better pasta and pizza before, but the atmosphere and service here really elevated the experience for me. Also, that S'mores Calzone is ridiculous, especially compared to a lot of pizza places that just have a sad fried dough or other forgettable dessert option. I would love to come back to try some more of the great food before this place takes off with the success it deserves."
